To this end, we explore here whether non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms can work via allosteric mechanisms. Using structure-based statistical mechanical model of allostery and analyzing energetics of the effects of mutations in a set of 27 proteins with at least 50 pathological SNPs in each molecule, we found that, indeed, some SNPs can work allosterically.

Allostery is rooted in the fundamental physical properties of macromolecular systems, but its underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. A collection of contributions to a recent interdisciplinary CECAM (Center Européen de Calcul Atomique et Moléculaire) workshop is used here to provide an overview of the progress and remaining limitations in the understanding of the mechanistic foundations of allostery gained from computational and experimental analyses of real protein systems and model systems. The main conceptual frameworks instrumental in driving the field are discussed. We illustrate the role of these frameworks in illuminating molecular mechanisms and explaining cellular processes, and describe some of their promising practical applications in engineering molecular sensors and informing drug design efforts.","categories":["Physics and Evolution of Biological Macromolecules","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"title":"Allostery in Its Many Disguises: From Theory to Applications"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlugs":["/group/physics-and-evolution-of-biological-macromolecules/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-toward-comprehensive-allosteric-control-over-protein-activity/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-02-28T02:43:42.278Z","description":"Universality of allosteric signaling in proteins, molecular machines, and receptors complemented by the great advantages of prospected allosteric drugs in the highly specific, non-competitive, and modulatory nature of their actions calls for deeper theoretical understanding of allosteric communication.

A Markov process describes the random walk of a traveling probe in the corresponding energy landscape, mimicking the motion of a biomolecule involved in chromatin function. By studying the metastability of the associated Markov State Model upon annealing, the hierarchical structure of individual chromosomes is observed, and corresponding set of structural partitions is identified at each level of hierarchy.
