In addressing the crux of the issue, various attempts to estimate the mutation rate of HIV-1 resulted in a large range of 10−5–10−3 errors/bp/cycle due to the use of different types of investigation methods.

Tracing or length measurement by the longest dimension are often inaccurate and time-consuming to carry out. Yet, proper wound area monitoring is essential for wound care. Instead of multiple clinical visits, which also increase the burden on health care systems and the associated expenses, patients can take the responsibility for their own wound progress.
