The transcription factor SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in solid tumor and leukemia cells. We developed a screen to identify compounds that reduce the viability of liver cancer cells that express high levels of SALL4, and we investigated their mechanisms.","categories":["Natural Product Biology","Natural Product Chemistry","Translational Research Division"],"title":"New High-Throughput Screening Identifies Compounds That Reduce Viability Specifically in Liver Cancer Cells That Express High Levels of SALL4 by Inhibiting Oxidative Phosphorylation"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlugs":["/group/gene-function-prediction/","/group/biomolecular-function-discovery-division/","/group/natural-product-biology/","/group/chemical-genomics/","/group/translational-research-division/"],"slug":"/posts/2020-01-16-genomics-driven-discovery-of-a-biosynthetic-gene-cluster-required-for-the-synthesis-of-bii-rafflesfungin-from-the-fungus-phoma-sp-f3723/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-05-23T06:49:32.241Z","description":"BACKGROUND:\nPhomafungin is a recently reported broad spectrum antifungal compound but its biosynthetic pathway is unknown.
