Although mutations in Sugct lead to Glutaric Aciduria Type 3 disease in humans, patients remain largely asymptomatic despite high levels of glutarate in the urine. To study the disease mechanism, we generated SugctKO mice and uncovered imbalanced lipid and acylcarnitine metabolism in kidney in addition to changes in the gut microbiome.

The transcription factor SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in solid tumor and leukemia cells. We developed a screen to identify compounds that reduce the viability of liver cancer cells that express high levels of SALL4, and we investigated their mechanisms.","categories":["Natural Product Biology","Natural Product Chemistry","Translational Research Division"],"title":"New High-Throughput Screening Identifies Compounds That Reduce Viability Specifically in Liver Cancer Cells That Express High Levels of SALL4 by Inhibiting Oxidative Phosphorylation"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlugs":["/group/natural-product-chemistry/","/group/translational-research-division/"],"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-lipid-accumulation-facilitates-mitotic-slippage-induced-adaptation-to-anti-mitotic-drug-treatment/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-11-27T06:39:27.561Z","description":"Aberrant lipid accumulation is a hallmark of cancer known to contribute to its aggressiveness and malignancy. Emerging studies have demonstrated context-dependent changes in lipid metabolism during chemotherapy. However, there is little known regarding the mechanisms linking lipid metabolism to chemotherapy-induced cell fates.
