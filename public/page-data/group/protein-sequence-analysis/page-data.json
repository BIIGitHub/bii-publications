Both viruses circulate in the same endemic settings and acute infections generally manifest similar symptoms. This highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis for clinical management and outbreak control. One of the commonly used acute diagnostic markers for flaviviruses is nonstructural protein 1 (NS1).

Although mutations in Sugct lead to Glutaric Aciduria Type 3 disease in humans, patients remain largely asymptomatic despite high levels of glutarate in the urine. To study the disease mechanism, we generated SugctKO mice and uncovered imbalanced lipid and acylcarnitine metabolism in kidney in addition to changes in the gut microbiome.
