Both viruses circulate in the same endemic settings and acute infections generally manifest similar symptoms. This highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis for clinical management and outbreak control. One of the commonly used acute diagnostic markers for flaviviruses is nonstructural protein 1 (NS1).

Mounting evidence suggests that interactions with the local environment may influence the architecture of these TM domains, which assemble via crucial sets of conserved ionisable residues, and also control the peripheral association of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) whose phosphorylation triggers cytoplasmic signalling cascades. We now report a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of the archetypal T cell receptor (TCR) and its cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) signalling partners, along with the analogous DNAX-activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12)/natural killer group 2C (NKG2C) complex.

TLR4 is of particular interest, since over-stimulation of its pathway by excess lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules from the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria can result in sepsis, which causes millions of deaths each year. In this review, we outline our use of molecular simulation approaches to gain a better understanding of the determinants of LPS recognition, towards the search for novel immunotherapeutics.
