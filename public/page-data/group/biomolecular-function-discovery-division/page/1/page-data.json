Usually, these are small and diminish before the main influenza season begins. However, the 2018/19 summer-autumn interseasonal influenza period in Australia saw unprecedented large and widespread influenza outbreaks.","categories":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"title":"Intense interseasonal influenza outbreaks, Australia, 2018/19"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlugs":["/group/analytics-of-biological-sequence-data/","/group/gene-function-prediction/","/group/biomolecular-function-discovery-division/"],"slug":"/posts/2020-01-07-translational-informatics-management-system-tims-towards-omics-based-clinical-data-management-for-long-term-curation-of-clinical-studies/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-08-03T07:20:58.632Z","description":"With the maturation of sequencing technology over the past decade, the cost associated to an OMICS based clinical study is no longer a limiting factor even for large cohorts, e.g., the UK’s 100K genomes project (Samuel & Farsides, 2017). However, the real cost of such a study goes beyond sequencing or data generation in general (Muir et al., 2016); the amount of raw sequencing data per sample can be quite sizable and quickly amass to quite a collection even for a modest cohort in contrast to the array based technology that it has inevitably displaced.","categories":["Analytics of Biological Sequence Data","Gene Function Prediction","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"title":"Translational Informatics Management System (TIMS): Towards OMICS based clinical data management for long term curation of clinical studies"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlugs":["/group/protein-sequence-analysis/","/group/biomolecular-function-discovery-division/"],"slug":"/posts/2020-01-07-influenza-passaging-annotations-what-they-tell-us-and-why-we-should-listen/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-06-30T07:31:51.260Z","description":"Influenza databases now contain over 100,000 worldwide sequence records for strains influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1).

At the same time, the desire to live and to live without disability is of much higher value to the patients.
