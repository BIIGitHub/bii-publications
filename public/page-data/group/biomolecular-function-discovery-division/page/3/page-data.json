The elderly are often stratified according to frailty status where frail individuals are more susceptible to adverse health outcomes than their non-frail counterparts, however, it is not known whether immunity induced by influenza vaccination is impaired in the frail elderly.","categories":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"title":"Influenza Vaccine-Induced Antibody Responses Are Not Impaired by Frailty in the Community-Dwelling Elderly With Natural Influenza Exposure"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"Biomolecular Function Discovery Division ","currentPage":3,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":24,"prevPagePath":"/group/biomolecular-function-discovery-division/page/2","nextPagePath":"/group/biomolecular-function-discovery-division/page/4","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":false}}}
