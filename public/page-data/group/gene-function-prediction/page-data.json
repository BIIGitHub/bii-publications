Although mutations in Sugct lead to Glutaric Aciduria Type 3 disease in humans, patients remain largely asymptomatic despite high levels of glutarate in the urine. To study the disease mechanism, we generated SugctKO mice and uncovered imbalanced lipid and acylcarnitine metabolism in kidney in addition to changes in the gut microbiome.

However, the real cost of such a study goes beyond sequencing or data generation in general (Muir et al., 2016); the amount of raw sequencing data per sample can be quite sizable and quickly amass to quite a collection even for a modest cohort in contrast to the array based technology that it has inevitably displaced.","categories":["Analytics of Biological Sequence Data","Gene Function Prediction","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"title":"Translational Informatics Management System (TIMS): Towards OMICS based clinical data management for long term curation of clinical studies"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlugs":["/group/analytics-of-biological-sequence-data/","/group/gene-function-prediction/","/group/biomolecular-function-discovery-division/"],"slug":"/posts/2020-01-10-hypocrisy-around-medical-patient-data-issues-of-access-for-biomedical-research-data-quality-usefulness-for-the-purpose-and-omics-data-as-game-changer/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-06-01T07:02:28.418Z","description":"Whether due to simplicity or hypocrisy, the question of access to patient data for biomedical research is widely seen in the public discourse only from the angle of patient privacy.
