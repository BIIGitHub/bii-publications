Aberrant HGF/c-MET upregulation and activation is frequently observed in bladder cancer correlating with cancer progression and invasion. However, the mechanisms underlying HGF/c-MET-mediated invasion in bladder cancer remains unknown. As part of a negative feedback loop SMAD7 binds to SMURF2 targeting the TGFβ receptor for degradation. Under these conditions, SMAD7 acts as a SMURF2 agonist by disrupting the intramolecular interactions within SMURF2. We demonstrate that HGF stimulates TGFβ signalling through c-SRC-mediated phosphorylation of SMURF2 resulting in loss of SMAD7 binding and enhanced SMURF2 C2-HECT interaction, inhibiting SMURF2 and enhancing TGFβ receptor stabilisation. This upregulation of the TGFβ pathway by HGF leads to TGFβ-mediated EMT and invasion. In vivo we show that TGFβ receptor inhibition prevents bladder cancer invasion. Furthermore, we make a rationale for the use of combinatorial TGFβ and MEK inhibitors for treatment of high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers.","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"title":"c-Met activation leads to the establishment of a TGFβ-receptor regulatory network in bladder cancer progression"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlugs":["/group/atomistic-simulations-and-design-in-biology/","/group/multiscale-simulation-modelling-and-design/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"slug":"/posts/2020-01-07-molecular-basis-of-dengue-virus-serotype-2-morphological-switch-from-29°c-to-37°c/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-09-19T06:13:28.009Z","description":"The ability of DENV2 to display different morphologies (hence different antigenic properties) complicates vaccine and therapeutics development.
