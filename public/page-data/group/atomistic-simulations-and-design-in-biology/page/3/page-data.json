The availability since the 1990s of a richness of biophysical data aimed at understanding its structure-function relationships has enabled the application of a variety of atomistic computational modelling techniques towards the establishment of mechanistic models.

Its levels are tightly regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. The complex between MDM2 and p53 is largely formed by the interaction between the N-terminal domain of MDM2 and the N-terminal transactivation (TA) domain of p53 (residues 15-29).

A subset of these mutations lowers the unfolding temperature of the DBD. Unfolding leads to the exposure of a hydrophobic β-strand and nucleates aggregation which results in pathologies through loss of function and dominant negative/gain of function effects.","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"title":"Simulations of mutant p53 DNA binding domains reveal a novel druggable pocket"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlugs":["/group/atomistic-simulations-and-design-in-biology/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-structural-insights-reveal-a-recognition-feature-for-tailoring-hydrocarbon-stapled-peptides-against-the-eukaryotic-translation-initiation-factor-4e-protein/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-01-07T03:45:12.278Z","description":"Stapled-peptides have emerged as an exciting class of molecules which can modulate protein–protein interactions.

Scientific Reports 2017, 7: 1540). The COSMIC cancer database is mined for EGFR sequences to discover that several mutations in the form of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) line this hydration cavity.
