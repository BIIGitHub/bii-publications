Aberrant HGF/c-MET upregulation and activation is frequently observed in bladder cancer correlating with cancer progression and invasion. However, the mechanisms underlying HGF/c-MET-mediated invasion in bladder cancer remains unknown. As part of a negative feedback loop SMAD7 binds to SMURF2 targeting the TGFβ receptor for degradation. Under these conditions, SMAD7 acts as a SMURF2 agonist by disrupting the intramolecular interactions within SMURF2. We demonstrate that HGF stimulates TGFβ signalling through c-SRC-mediated phosphorylation of SMURF2 resulting in loss of SMAD7 binding and enhanced SMURF2 C2-HECT interaction, inhibiting SMURF2 and enhancing TGFβ receptor stabilisation. This upregulation of the TGFβ pathway by HGF leads to TGFβ-mediated EMT and invasion. In vivo we show that TGFβ receptor inhibition prevents bladder cancer invasion. Furthermore, we make a rationale for the use of combinatorial TGFβ and MEK inhibitors for treatment of high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers.","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"title":"c-Met activation leads to the establishment of a TGFβ-receptor regulatory network in bladder cancer progression"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlugs":["/group/atomistic-simulations-and-design-in-biology/","/group/multiscale-simulation-modelling-and-design/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"slug":"/posts/2020-01-07-molecular-basis-of-dengue-virus-serotype-2-morphological-switch-from-29°c-to-37°c/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-09-19T06:13:28.009Z","description":"The ability of DENV2 to display different morphologies (hence different antigenic properties) complicates vaccine and therapeutics development.

Mounting evidence suggests that interactions with the local environment may influence the architecture of these TM domains, which assemble via crucial sets of conserved ionisable residues, and also control the peripheral association of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) whose phosphorylation triggers cytoplasmic signalling cascades. We now report a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of the archetypal T cell receptor (TCR) and its cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) signalling partners, along with the analogous DNAX-activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12)/natural killer group 2C (NKG2C) complex.
