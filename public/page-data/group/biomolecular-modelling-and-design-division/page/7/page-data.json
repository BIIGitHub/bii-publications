The underlying mechanism has been hypothesized to result from differences in structural constraints introduced by the mutations and stabilizing interactions afforded by a buried water molecule in 19del (Kannan S. et al. Scientific Reports 2017, 7: 1540). The COSMIC cancer database is mined for EGFR sequences to discover that several mutations in the form of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) line this hydration cavity.

Fully immature DENV (immDENV) is generally non-infectious, but can become infectious when complexed with anti-precursor membrane (prM) protein antibodies. It is unknown how anti-prM antibody-coated particles can undergo membrane fusion since the prM caps the envelope (E) protein fusion loop.

This recurring trait of allostery serves as a foundation for developing different experimental efforts and theoretical models for the studies of allosteric mechanisms. Among computational approaches considered here particular emphasis is given to the structure-based statistical mechanical model of allostery (SBSMMA), which allows one to study the causality and energetics of allosteric communication.
