Inter-subunit protein-protein interfaces that stabilize Reptin in its oligomeric state are not well-defined. A self-peptide binding assay identified a protein-peptide interface mapping to an inter-subunit “rim” of the hexamer bridged by Tyrosine-340. A Y340A mutation reduced ADP-dependent oligomer formation using a gel filtration assay, suggesting that Y340 forms a dominant oligomer stabilizing side chain.

They pump protons against an ion gradient, driven by a mechano-chemical framework that exploits ATP hydrolysis as an energy source. This process drives the rotation of the so-called c-ring, a membrane embedded complex in the Vo-domain of the V-type ATPase, resulting in translocation of protons across the membrane. One way in which the enzyme is regulated is by disassembly and reassembly of the V1-domain with the Vo-domain, which inactivates and reactivates the enzyme, respectively.
