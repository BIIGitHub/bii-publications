However, the real cost of such a study goes beyond sequencing or data generation in general (Muir et al., 2016); the amount of raw sequencing data per sample can be quite sizable and quickly amass to quite a collection even for a modest cohort in contrast to the array based technology that it has inevitably displaced.","categories":["Analytics of Biological Sequence Data","Gene Function Prediction","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"title":"Translational Informatics Management System (TIMS): Towards OMICS based clinical data management for long term curation of clinical studies"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlugs":["/group/analytics-of-biological-sequence-data/","/group/gene-function-prediction/","/group/biomolecular-function-discovery-division/"],"slug":"/posts/2020-01-10-hypocrisy-around-medical-patient-data-issues-of-access-for-biomedical-research-data-quality-usefulness-for-the-purpose-and-omics-data-as-game-changer/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-06-01T07:02:28.418Z","description":"Whether due to simplicity or hypocrisy, the question of access to patient data for biomedical research is widely seen in the public discourse only from the angle of patient privacy. At the same time, the desire to live and to live without disability is of much higher value to the patients. This goal can only be achieved by extracting research insight from patient data in addition to working on model organisms, something that is well understood by many patients.
