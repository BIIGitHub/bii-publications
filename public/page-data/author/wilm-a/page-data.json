By whole-genome sequencing of 4,810 Singapore Chinese, Malays, and Indians, we found 98.3 million SNPs and small insertions or deletions, over half of which are novel."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-02-27-structure-mapping-of-dengue-and-zika-viruses-reveals-functional-long-range-interactions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Structure mapping of dengue and Zika viruses reveals functional long-range interactions","date":"2019-03-29T07:30:07.749Z","categories":["Function and Structure of RNA","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division ","Multiscale Simulation, Modelling and Design","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are clinically important members of the Flaviviridae family with an 11â€‰kb positive strand RNA genome that folds to enable virus function. Here, we perform structure and interaction mapping on four DENV and ZIKV strains inside virions and in infected cells. Comparative analysis of SHAPE reactivities across serotypes nominates potentially functional regions that are highly structured, conserved, and contain low synonymous mutation rates.
