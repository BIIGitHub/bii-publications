The elderly are often stratified according to frailty status where frail individuals are more susceptible to adverse health outcomes than their non-frail counterparts, however, it is not known whether immunity induced by influenza vaccination is impaired in the frail elderly."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Camous XFN","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/camous-xfn","nextPagePath":"/author/camous-xfn/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
