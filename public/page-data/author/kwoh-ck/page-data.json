Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are routinely used to probe such interactions. However, detailed analyses and interpretation of the hydration patterns seen in MD simulations can be both complex and time-consuming.

A subset of these mutations lowers the unfolding temperature of the DBD. Unfolding leads to the exposure of a hydrophobic Î²-strand and nucleates aggregation which results in pathologies through loss of function and dominant negative/gain of function effects."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Kwoh CK","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/kwoh-ck","nextPagePath":"/author/kwoh-ck/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
