The use of phylogenetics to identify and differentiate between clusters of genetically similar pathogens is particularly prevalent in virology from the nomenclature of human papillomaviruses to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5Nx viruses. These nomenclature systems rely on absolute genetic distance thresholds to define the maximum genetic divergence tolerated between viruses designated as closely related.

The FAO/WHO guidelines for computational assessment of allergenic potential of proteins based on short peptide hits and linear sequence window identity thresholds misclassify many proteins as allergens."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-individual-immune-selection-pressure-has-limited-impact-on-seasonal-influenza-virus-evolution/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Individual immune selection pressure has limited impact on seasonal influenza virus evolution","date":"2018-12-06T06:08:03.279Z","categories":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"description":"Seasonal influenza viruses are subjected to strong selection as seen by the sequential replacement of existing viral populations on the emergence of new antigenic variants. However, the process of within-host de novo mutant generation and evolutionary selection that underlies these antigenic sweeps is poorly understood. Here, we investigate mutational patterns between evolutionarily closely related human seasonal influenza viruses using host age as a proxy for immune experience.

The elderly are often stratified according to frailty status where frail individuals are more susceptible to adverse health outcomes than their non-frail counterparts, however, it is not known whether immunity induced by influenza vaccination is impaired in the frail elderly."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Maurer-Stroh S","currentPage":1,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":8,"prevPagePath":"/author/maurer-stroh-s","nextPagePath":"/author/maurer-stroh-s/page/2","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":false}}}
