Both viruses circulate in the same endemic settings and acute infections generally manifest similar symptoms. This highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis for clinical management and outbreak control. One of the commonly used acute diagnostic markers for flaviviruses is nonstructural protein 1 (NS1).

Although mutations in Sugct lead to Glutaric Aciduria Type 3 disease in humans, patients remain largely asymptomatic despite high levels of glutarate in the urine. To study the disease mechanism, we generated SugctKO mice and uncovered imbalanced lipid and acylcarnitine metabolism in kidney in addition to changes in the gut microbiome.

As a safe, higher-throughput alternative, we explore the possibility of using readily available passage bias data obtained mostly from seasonal H1 and H3 influenza strains that were differentially grown in mammalian (MDCK) and avian cells (eggs)."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-07-rare-human-missense-variants-can-affect-the-function-of-disease-relevant-proteins-by-loss-and-gain-of-peroxisomal-targeting-motifs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rare Human Missense Variants can affect the Function of Disease-Relevant Proteins by Loss and Gain of Peroxisomal Targeting Motifs","date":"2019-09-17T06:20:39.921Z","categories":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"description":"Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) resulting in amino acid substitutions (i.e., missense variants) can affect protein localization by changing or creating new targeting signals. Here, we studied the potential of naturally occurring SNVs from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) to result in the loss of an existing peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) or gain of a novel PTS1 leading to mistargeting of cytosolic proteins to peroxisomes."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-07-intense-interseasonal-influenza-outbreaks-australia-2018-19/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Intense interseasonal influenza outbreaks, Australia, 2018/19","date":"2019-08-15T06:57:04.260Z","categories":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"description":"Background\nInterseasonal influenza outbreaks are not unusual in countries with temperate climates and well-defined influenza seasons. Usually, these are small and diminish before the main influenza season begins. However, the 2018/19 summer-autumn interseasonal influenza period in Australia saw unprecedented large and widespread influenza outbreaks."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-07-influenza-passaging-annotations-what-they-tell-us-and-why-we-should-listen/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Influenza passaging annotations: what they tell us and why we should listen","date":"2019-06-30T07:31:51.260Z","categories":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"description":"Influenza databases now contain over 100,000 worldwide sequence records for strains influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1). Although these data facilitate global research efforts and vaccine development practices, they also represent a stumbling block for researchers because of their confusing and heterogeneous annotation.

As resistance against drugs targeting viral proteins emerges rapidly, we assessed the antiviral activity of already approved drugs that target cellular proteins involved in the viral life cycle and were orally bioavailable. diseases."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-02-04-a-novel-method-for-the-capture-based-purification-of-whole-viral-native-rna-genomes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A novel method for the capture-based purification of whole viral native RNA genomes","date":"2019-05-08T09:21:35.165Z","categories":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"description":"Current technologies for targeted characterization and manipulation of viral RNA primarily involve amplification or ultracentrifugation with isopycnic gradients of viral particles to decrease host RNA background. The former strategy is non-compatible for characterizing properties innate to RNA strands such as secondary structure, RNA-RNA interactions, and also for nanopore direct RNA sequencing involving the sequencing of native RNA strands.
