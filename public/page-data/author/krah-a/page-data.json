One important defense strategy is the ability to export drugs by multidrug transporters. One class of multidrug transporter, the so-called multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters, extrude a variety of antibiotic compounds from the bacterial cytoplasm."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-19-insights-into-water-accessible-pathways-and-the-inactivation-mechanism-of-proton-translocation-by-the-membrane-embedded-domain-of-v-type-atpases/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Insights into water accessible pathways and the inactivation mechanism of proton translocation by the membrane-embedded domain of V-type ATPases","date":"2019-03-01T09:50:31.607Z","categories":["Multiscale Simulation, Modelling and Design","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"V-type ATPases are multi-protein complexes, which acidify cellular compartments in eukaryotes. They pump protons against an ion gradient, driven by a mechano-chemical framework that exploits ATP hydrolysis as an energy source. This process drives the rotation of the so-called c-ring, a membrane embedded complex in the Vo-domain of the V-type ATPase, resulting in translocation of protons across the membrane. One way in which the enzyme is regulated is by disassembly and reassembly of the V1-domain with the Vo-domain, which inactivates and reactivates the enzyme, respectively.
