The transcription factor SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in solid tumor and leukemia cells. We developed a screen to identify compounds that reduce the viability of liver cancer cells that express high levels of SALL4, and we investigated their mechanisms."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-10-targeted-covalent-inhibitors-of-mdm2-using-electrophile-bearing-stapled-peptides/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Targeted covalent inhibitors of MDM2 using electrophile-bearing stapled peptides","date":"2019-06-17T06:02:12.164Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Herein, we describe the development of a novel staple with an electrophilic warhead to enable the generation of stapled peptide covalent inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 protein-protein interaction (PPI).
