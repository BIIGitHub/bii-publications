As resistance against drugs targeting viral proteins emerges rapidly, we assessed the antiviral activity of already approved drugs that target cellular proteins involved in the viral life cycle and were orally bioavailable. diseases."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Enkirch T","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/enkirch-t","nextPagePath":"/author/enkirch-t/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
