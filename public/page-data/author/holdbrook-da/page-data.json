TLR4 is of particular interest, since over-stimulation of its pathway by excess lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules from the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria can result in sepsis, which causes millions of deaths each year. In this review, we outline our use of molecular simulation approaches to gain a better understanding of the determinants of LPS recognition, towards the search for novel immunotherapeutics.

Naturally, a large apparatus of biomolecules is responsible for construction, maintenance, transport, and degradation of these lipid barriers.
