In addition to the development of small molecules, there has been interest in developing constrained (stapled) peptide inhibitors. A stapled peptide ALRN_6924 that activates p53 by preventing its interaction with its negative regulator Mdm2 has entered clinical trials. This stapled peptide mimics the interaction of p53 with Mdm2.

RON is often found to be alternatively spliced resulting in various isoforms that are constitutively active. RON is therefore an attractive target for cancer therapeutics, including small molecular inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies.

As a model system for probing the chemical space available for optimizing these properties, we focused on dual Mdm2/MdmX antagonist stapled peptides related to the p53 N-terminus.

Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are routinely used to probe such interactions.

A subset of these mutations lowers the unfolding temperature of the DBD. Unfolding leads to the exposure of a hydrophobic β-strand and nucleates aggregation which results in pathologies through loss of function and dominant negative/gain of function effects."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-structural-insights-reveal-a-recognition-feature-for-tailoring-hydrocarbon-stapled-peptides-against-the-eukaryotic-translation-initiation-factor-4e-protein/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Structural insights reveal a recognition feature for tailoring hydrocarbon stapled-peptides against the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E protein","date":"2019-01-07T03:45:12.278Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Stapled-peptides have emerged as an exciting class of molecules which can modulate protein–protein interactions.
