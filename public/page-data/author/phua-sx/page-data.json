Given that VH family biases have been previously reported in IgE of certain allergies, there is a need to investigate this phenomenon for biotechnological and therapeutic purposes."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-perspective-the-promises-of-a-holistic-view-of-proteins-impact-on-antibody-engineering-and-drug-discovery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Perspective: The promises of a holistic view of proteins-impact on antibody engineering and drug discovery","date":"2019-01-10T03:43:20.279Z","categories":["Antibody and Product Development","Translational Research Division"],"description":"The reductionist approach is prevalent in biomedical science. However, increasing evidence now shows that biological systems cannot be simply considered as the sum of its parts. With experimental, technological and computational advances, we can now do more than view parts in isolation, thus wepropose that an increasing holistic view (where a protein is investigated as much as a whole as possible) is now timely.

Yet, conveying scientific concepts easily is precisely what scientific publications are meant to do.
