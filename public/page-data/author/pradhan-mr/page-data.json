Due to their integral role in numerous biological functions, their ability to act as scaffolds for signal amplification, and the occurrence of mutations linked to human diseases, PDZ domains are attractive therapeutic targets.

As a model system for probing the chemical space available for optimizing these properties, we focused on dual Mdm2/MdmX antagonist stapled peptides related to the p53 N-terminus.

Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are routinely used to probe such interactions.

A subset of these mutations lowers the unfolding temperature of the DBD. Unfolding leads to the exposure of a hydrophobic β-strand and nucleates aggregation which results in pathologies through loss of function and dominant negative/gain of function effects."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Pradhan MR","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/pradhan-mr","nextPagePath":"/author/pradhan-mr/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
