The mycobacterial enzyme is also unique as a result of its 111 amino acids extended δ subunit, whose gene is fused to the peripheral stalk subunit b. Recently, the crystallographic structures of the mycobacterial α3:β3:γ:ε-domain and c subunit ring were resolved. Here, we report the first purification protocol of the intact M."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-02-27-effect-of-the-additional-cysteine-503-of-vancomycin-resistant-enterococcus-faecalis-v583-alkylhydroperoxide-reductase-subunit-f-ahpf-and-the-mechanism-of-ahpf-and-subunit-c-assembling/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Effect of the additional cysteine 503 of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (V583) alkylhydroperoxide reductase subunit F (AhpF) and the mechanism of AhpF and subunit C assembling","date":"2019-04-30T02:46:54.274Z","categories":["Gene Function Prediction","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"description":"The vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis alkyl hydroperoxide reductase complex (AhpR) with its subunits AhpC (EfAhpC) and AhpF (EfAhpF) is of paramount importance to restore redox homeostasis. Therefore, knowledge about this defense system is essential to understand its antibiotic-resistance and survival in hosts.
