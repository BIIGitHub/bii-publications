The mycobacterial enzyme is also unique as a result of its 111 amino acids extended δ subunit, whose gene is fused to the peripheral stalk subunit b. Recently, the crystallographic structures of the mycobacterial α3:β3:γ:ε-domain and c subunit ring were resolved. Here, we report the first purification protocol of the intact M."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Bhushan S","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/bhushan-s","nextPagePath":"/author/bhushan-s/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
