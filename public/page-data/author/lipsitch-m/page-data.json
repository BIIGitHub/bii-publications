As a safe, higher-throughput alternative, we explore the possibility of using readily available passage bias data obtained mostly from seasonal H1 and H3 influenza strains that were differentially grown in mammalian (MDCK) and avian cells (eggs)."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Lipsitch M","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/lipsitch-m","nextPagePath":"/author/lipsitch-m/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
