Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are routinely used to probe such interactions. However, detailed analyses and interpretation of the hydration patterns seen in MD simulations can be both complex and time-consuming.

Given the rapid pace with which new antibody–antigen structures are deposited in the protein databank (PDB), it is crucial to have computational tools to analyze contact residues and interfacial waters, and investigate them at different levels.

The FAO/WHO guidelines for computational assessment of allergenic potential of proteins based on short peptide hits and linear sequence window identity thresholds misclassify many proteins as allergens."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-simulations-of-mutant-p53-dna-binding-domains-reveal-a-novel-druggable-pocket/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Simulations of mutant p53 DNA binding domains reveal a novel druggable pocket","date":"2019-01-15T03:38:50.419Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"The DNA binding domain (DBD) of the tumor suppressor p53 is the site of several oncogenic mutations. A subset of these mutations lowers the unfolding temperature of the DBD. Unfolding leads to the exposure of a hydrophobic β-strand and nucleates aggregation which results in pathologies through loss of function and dominant negative/gain of function effects."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Nguyen MN","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/nguyen-mn","nextPagePath":"/author/nguyen-mn/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
