Templated ordering of 3-dimensional space around amorphous embedded non-equilibrium phases at heterogeneous polymer─metal interfaces signify important routes for the genesis of low-dimensional materials under stress-induced polymer confinement."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-09-deciphering-the-mechanistic-effects-of-eif4e-phosphorylation-on-mrna‐cap-recognition/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deciphering the mechanistic effects of eIF4E phosphorylation on mRNA‐cap recognition","date":"2019-12-06T09:16:02.576Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"The mRNA cap‐binding oncoprotein “eIF4E” is phosphorylated at residue S209 by Mnk kinases, and is closely associated with tumor development and progression. Despite being well‐established, mechanistic details at the molecular level of mRNA recognition by eIF4E due to phosphorylation have not been clearly elucidated. We investigated this through molecular modeling and simulations of the S209 phosphorylated derivative of eIF4E and explored the associated implication on the binding of the different variants of mRNA‐cap analogs.

In addition to the development of small molecules, there has been interest in developing constrained (stapled) peptide inhibitors. A stapled peptide ALRN_6924 that activates p53 by preventing its interaction with its negative regulator Mdm2 has entered clinical trials. This stapled peptide mimics the interaction of p53 with Mdm2.

Aberrant HGF/c-MET upregulation and activation is frequently observed in bladder cancer correlating with cancer progression and invasion. However, the mechanisms underlying HGF/c-MET-mediated invasion in bladder cancer remains unknown. As part of a negative feedback loop SMAD7 binds to SMURF2 targeting the TGFβ receptor for degradation. Under these conditions, SMAD7 acts as a SMURF2 agonist by disrupting the intramolecular interactions within SMURF2. We demonstrate that HGF stimulates TGFβ signalling through c-SRC-mediated phosphorylation of SMURF2 resulting in loss of SMAD7 binding and enhanced SMURF2 C2-HECT interaction, inhibiting SMURF2 and enhancing TGFβ receptor stabilisation. This upregulation of the TGFβ pathway by HGF leads to TGFβ-mediated EMT and invasion. In vivo we show that TGFβ receptor inhibition prevents bladder cancer invasion. Furthermore, we make a rationale for the use of combinatorial TGFβ and MEK inhibitors for treatment of high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-07-molecular-basis-of-dengue-virus-serotype-2-morphological-switch-from-29°c-to-37°c/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Molecular basis of dengue virus serotype 2 morphological switch from 29°C to 37°C","date":"2019-09-19T06:13:28.009Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Multiscale Simulation, Modelling and Design","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"The ability of DENV2 to display different morphologies (hence different antigenic properties) complicates vaccine and therapeutics development.

The cement proteins (CPs) have previously been identified and sequenced.
