The availability since the 1990s of a richness of biophysical data aimed at understanding its structure-function relationships has enabled the application of a variety of atomistic computational modelling techniques towards the establishment of mechanistic models.

Its levels are tightly regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. The complex between MDM2 and p53 is largely formed by the interaction between the N-terminal domain of MDM2 and the N-terminal transactivation (TA) domain of p53 (residues 15-29).

A subset of these mutations lowers the unfolding temperature of the DBD. Unfolding leads to the exposure of a hydrophobic Î²-strand and nucleates aggregation which results in pathologies through loss of function and dominant negative/gain of function effects."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-effects-of-single-nucleotide-polymorphisms-on-the-binding-of-afatinib-to-egfr-a-potential-patient-stratification-factor-revealed-by-modeling-studies/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Effects of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms on the Binding of Afatinib to EGFR: A Potential Patient Stratification Factor Revealed by Modeling Studies","date":"2018-11-27T06:29:51.279Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"The anticancer drug afatinib has been found to be more effective at inhibiting the oncogenic EGFR mutant exon 19 deletion (19del) over the oncogenic EGFR mutant L858R. The underlying mechanism has been hypothesized to result from differences in structural constraints introduced by the mutations and stabilizing interactions afforded by a buried water molecule in 19del (Kannan S. et al. Scientific Reports 2017, 7: 1540). The COSMIC cancer database is mined for EGFR sequences to discover that several mutations in the form of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) line this hydration cavity.
