Due to their integral role in numerous biological functions, their ability to act as scaffolds for signal amplification, and the occurrence of mutations linked to human diseases, PDZ domains are attractive therapeutic targets.

As a model system for probing the chemical space available for optimizing these properties, we focused on dual Mdm2/MdmX antagonist stapled peptides related to the p53 N-terminus.

There is a clear need for rigorous methods to predict the likelihood of specific drug-resistance mutations arising in response to the binding of a drug. In this work we attempt to develop a robust computational protocol for predicting drug resistant mutations at the gatekeeper position (T790) in EGFR.
