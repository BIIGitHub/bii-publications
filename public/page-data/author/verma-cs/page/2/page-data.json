Given the rapid pace with which new antibody–antigen structures are deposited in the protein databank (PDB), it is crucial to have computational tools to analyze contact residues and interfacial waters, and investigate them at different levels.

Peptides are a potential solution for disrupting PPIs; however, they typically suffer from poor stability in vivo and limited tissue penetration hampering their wide spread use as new chemical biology tools and potential therapeutics."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-19-inhibition-of-the-nlrp3-inflammasome-activation-by-cell-permeable-stapled-peptides/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation by cell-permeable stapled peptides","date":"2019-03-20T09:25:06.119Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a major cytokine that initiates and enhances inflammatory responses.

Its levels are elevated in several cancers such as malignant melanoma and correlate directly with poor prognosis in patients. S100B(ββ) directly interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, inhibiting tetramerization and protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation, consequently decreasing p53 DNA binding and transcriptional activity, and preventing apoptosis."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-19-an-inter-subunit-protein-peptide-interface-that-stabilizes-the-specific-activity-and-oligomerization-of-the-aaa-chaperone-reptin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"An inter-subunit protein-peptide interface that stabilizes the specific activity and oligomerization of the AAA+ chaperone Reptin","date":"2019-03-09T09:46:46.605Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Reptin is a member of the AAA+ superfamily whose members can exist in equilibrium between monomeric apo forms and ligand bound hexamers. Inter-subunit protein-protein interfaces that stabilize Reptin in its oligomeric state are not well-defined. A self-peptide binding assay identified a protein-peptide interface mapping to an inter-subunit “rim” of the hexamer bridged by Tyrosine-340. A Y340A mutation reduced ADP-dependent oligomer formation using a gel filtration assay, suggesting that Y340 forms a dominant oligomer stabilizing side chain.

There is a likelihood that other proteins could have binding sites that are structurally similar to the target protein. Binding to these other proteins could alter their activities leading to off target effects of the drug."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Verma CS","currentPage":2,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":16,"prevPagePath":"/author/verma-cs/page/1","nextPagePath":"/author/verma-cs/page/3","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":true}}}
