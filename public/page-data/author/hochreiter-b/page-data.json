Here, we studied the potential of naturally occurring SNVs from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) to result in the loss of an existing peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) or gain of a novel PTS1 leading to mistargeting of cytosolic proteins to peroxisomes."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Hochreiter B","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/hochreiter-b","nextPagePath":"/author/hochreiter-b/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
