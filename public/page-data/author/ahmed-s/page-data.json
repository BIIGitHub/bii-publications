To this day, there is an unmet need to enrich these cells from a heterogeneous cell population for clinical applications without irreversible manipulation. We identified a method to propagate human NCSs via computational analysis of their mechanical signature."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-superresolution-microscopy-reveals-distinct-localisation-of-full-length-irsp53-and-its-i-bar-domain-protein-within-filopodia/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Superresolution microscopy reveals distinct localisation of full length IRSp53 and its I-BAR domain protein within filopodia","date":"2019-02-21T03:00:37.279Z","categories":["Biophysical Modelling","Imaging Informatics Division"],"description":"Superresolution microscopy offers the advantage of imaging biological structures within cells at the nano-scale. Here we apply two superresolution microscopy techniques, specifically 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), a type of single molecule localisation microscopy, to localise IRSp53 protein and its I-BAR domain in relation to F-actin within filopodia."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Ahmed S","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/ahmed-s","nextPagePath":"/author/ahmed-s/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
