Auroramycin, a potent antimicrobial doubly glycosylated 24-membered polyene macrolactam, was previously isolated and characterized, following CRISPR-Cas9 mediated activation of a silent polyketide synthase biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces rosesporous NRRL 15998.

Mono-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (MEHP) is an active metabolite of di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), a commonly used plasticizer. MEHP adversely affects human health causing hepatotoxicity and reproductive toxicity. How MEHP affects cellular physiology is not fully understood.
