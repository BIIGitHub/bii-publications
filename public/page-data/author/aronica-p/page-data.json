As a model system for probing the chemical space available for optimizing these properties, we focused on dual Mdm2/MdmX antagonist stapled peptides related to the p53 N-terminus.

Its levels are elevated in several cancers such as malignant melanoma and correlate directly with poor prognosis in patients. S100B(ββ) directly interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, inhibiting tetramerization and protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation, consequently decreasing p53 DNA binding and transcriptional activity, and preventing apoptosis."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Aronica P","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/aronica-p","nextPagePath":"/author/aronica-p/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
