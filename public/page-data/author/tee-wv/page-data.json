To this end, we explore here whether non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms can work via allosteric mechanisms. Using structure-based statistical mechanical model of allostery and analyzing energetics of the effects of mutations in a set of 27 proteins with at least 50 pathological SNPs in each molecule, we found that, indeed, some SNPs can work allosterically.
