The FAO/WHO guidelines for computational assessment of allergenic potential of proteins based on short peptide hits and linear sequence window identity thresholds misclassify many proteins as allergens."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-the-geographic-variation-of-surveillance-and-zoonotic-spillover-potential-of-influenza-viruses-in-domestic-poultry-and-swine/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Geographic Variation of Surveillance and Zoonotic Spillover Potential of Influenza Viruses in Domestic Poultry and Swine","date":"2018-11-27T06:37:02.553Z","categories":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Gene Function Prediction","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"description":"Background\nAvian and swine influenza viruses circulate worldwide and pose threats to both animal and human health.
