A subset of these mutations lowers the unfolding temperature of the DBD. Unfolding leads to the exposure of a hydrophobic Î²-strand and nucleates aggregation which results in pathologies through loss of function and dominant negative/gain of function effects."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-effects-of-single-nucleotide-polymorphisms-on-the-binding-of-afatinib-to-egfr-a-potential-patient-stratification-factor-revealed-by-modeling-studies/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Effects of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms on the Binding of Afatinib to EGFR: A Potential Patient Stratification Factor Revealed by Modeling Studies","date":"2018-11-27T06:29:51.279Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"The anticancer drug afatinib has been found to be more effective at inhibiting the oncogenic EGFR mutant exon 19 deletion (19del) over the oncogenic EGFR mutant L858R. The underlying mechanism has been hypothesized to result from differences in structural constraints introduced by the mutations and stabilizing interactions afforded by a buried water molecule in 19del (Kannan S. et al. Scientific Reports 2017, 7: 1540). The COSMIC cancer database is mined for EGFR sequences to discover that several mutations in the form of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) line this hydration cavity.
