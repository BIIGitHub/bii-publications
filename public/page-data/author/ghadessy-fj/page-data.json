Alternative microbial-based production methodologies are being developed with the aim of providing “green” acrylic acid. These initiatives will benefit from component sensing tools that facilitate rapid and easy detection of in vivo AA production.\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Ghadessy FJ","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/ghadessy-fj","nextPagePath":"/author/ghadessy-fj/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
