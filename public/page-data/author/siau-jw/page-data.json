A subset of these mutations lowers the unfolding temperature of the DBD. Unfolding leads to the exposure of a hydrophobic Î²-strand and nucleates aggregation which results in pathologies through loss of function and dominant negative/gain of function effects."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Siau JW","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/siau-jw","nextPagePath":"/author/siau-jw/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
