Mounting evidence suggests that interactions with the local environment may influence the architecture of these TM domains, which assemble via crucial sets of conserved ionisable residues, and also control the peripheral association of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) whose phosphorylation triggers cytoplasmic signalling cascades. We now report a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of the archetypal T cell receptor (TCR) and its cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) signalling partners, along with the analogous DNAX-activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12)/natural killer group 2C (NKG2C) complex.

Naturally, a large apparatus of biomolecules is responsible for construction, maintenance, transport, and degradation of these lipid barriers.
