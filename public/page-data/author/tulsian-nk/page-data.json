The HK EnvZ is a global sensor of osmolality and cellular acid pH. In previous studies, we discovered that osmosensing in EnvZ was mediated through osmolyte-induced stabilization of the partially disordered helical backbone spanning the conserved histidine autophosphorylation site (His243)."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Tulsian NK","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/tulsian-nk","nextPagePath":"/author/tulsian-nk/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
