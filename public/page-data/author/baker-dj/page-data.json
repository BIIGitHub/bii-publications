Peptides are a potential solution for disrupting PPIs; however, they typically suffer from poor stability in vivo and limited tissue penetration hampering their wide spread use as new chemical biology tools and potential therapeutics."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Baker DJ","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/baker-dj","nextPagePath":"/author/baker-dj/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
