There is a likelihood that other proteins could have binding sites that are structurally similar to the target protein. Binding to these other proteins could alter their activities leading to off target effects of the drug."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Tanavde V","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/tanavde-v","nextPagePath":"/author/tanavde-v/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
