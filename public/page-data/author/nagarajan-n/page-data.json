Alternative microbial-based production methodologies are being developed with the aim of providing “green” acrylic acid. These initiatives will benefit from component sensing tools that facilitate rapid and easy detection of in vivo AA production.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-02-27-structure-mapping-of-dengue-and-zika-viruses-reveals-functional-long-range-interactions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Structure mapping of dengue and Zika viruses reveals functional long-range interactions","date":"2019-03-29T07:30:07.749Z","categories":["Function and Structure of RNA","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division ","Multiscale Simulation, Modelling and Design","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are clinically important members of the Flaviviridae family with an 11 kb positive strand RNA genome that folds to enable virus function. Here, we perform structure and interaction mapping on four DENV and ZIKV strains inside virions and in infected cells. Comparative analysis of SHAPE reactivities across serotypes nominates potentially functional regions that are highly structured, conserved, and contain low synonymous mutation rates.
