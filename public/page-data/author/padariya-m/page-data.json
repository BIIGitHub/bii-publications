The master regulator of NMD is UPF1, an enzyme with intrinsic ATPase and helicase activities. The cancer genomic sequencing data has identified frequently mutated residues in the CH-domain and ATP-binding site of UPF1."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Padariya M","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/padariya-m","nextPagePath":"/author/padariya-m/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
