As a model system for probing the chemical space available for optimizing these properties, we focused on dual Mdm2/MdmX antagonist stapled peptides related to the p53 N-terminus.

Peptides are a potential solution for disrupting PPIs; however, they typically suffer from poor stability in vivo and limited tissue penetration hampering their wide spread use as new chemical biology tools and potential therapeutics."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-19-inhibiting-s100b-ββ-for-activating-wild-type-p53-design-of-stapled-peptides/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Inhibiting S100B(ββ) for Activating Wild-Type p53: Design of Stapled Peptides","date":"2019-03-14T09:41:16.607Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"S100B(ββ) is a member of the S100B protein family and is distributed in a cell-specific manner. Its levels are elevated in several cancers such as malignant melanoma and correlate directly with poor prognosis in patients. S100B(ββ) directly interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, inhibiting tetramerization and protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation, consequently decreasing p53 DNA binding and transcriptional activity, and preventing apoptosis."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-roles-of-computational-modelling-in-understanding-p53-structure-biology-and-its-therapeutic-targeting/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Roles of computational modelling in understanding p53 structure, biology, and its therapeutic targeting","date":"2019-02-06T03:13:35.279Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"The multi-faceted role of the transcription factor p53 is key to numerous biological processes, including the suppression of tumours. The availability since the 1990s of a richness of biophysical data aimed at understanding its structure-function relationships has enabled the application of a variety of atomistic computational modelling techniques towards the establishment of mechanistic models.

Its levels are tightly regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. The complex between MDM2 and p53 is largely formed by the interaction between the N-terminal domain of MDM2 and the N-terminal transactivation (TA) domain of p53 (residues 15-29).
