Genetic duplication processes give rise to sets of regulatory proteins that have evolved from a common ancestor, leading to interactomes whose dysregulation is often associated with disease. A better understanding of the determinants of specificity at 21 interfaces shared by functionally related proteins is crucial to the rational design of novel pharmacotherapeutic agents.
