The primary objective of this work was to compare PODs based on high-throughput predictions of bioactivity, exposure predictions, and traditional hazard information for 448 chemicals.

However, the direct effects of talc particles to lung carcinoma cells, which can be found in the MPE fluids from lung cancer patients, are not fully understood.
