The transcription factor SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in solid tumor and leukemia cells. We developed a screen to identify compounds that reduce the viability of liver cancer cells that express high levels of SALL4, and we investigated their mechanisms."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Chai L","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/chai-l","nextPagePath":"/author/chai-l/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
