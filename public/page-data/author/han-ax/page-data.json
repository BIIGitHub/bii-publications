Usually, these are small and diminish before the main influenza season begins. However, the 2018/19 summer-autumn interseasonal influenza period in Australia saw unprecedented large and widespread influenza outbreaks."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-19-phylogenetic-clustering-by-linear-integer-programming-phyclip/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Phylogenetic Clustering by Linear Integer Programming (PhyCLIP)","date":"2019-03-11T09:44:02.609Z","categories":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"description":"Sub-species nomenclature systems of pathogens are increasingly based on sequence data. The use of phylogenetics to identify and differentiate between clusters of genetically similar pathogens is particularly prevalent in virology from the nomenclature of human papillomaviruses to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5Nx viruses. These nomenclature systems rely on absolute genetic distance thresholds to define the maximum genetic divergence tolerated between viruses designated as closely related.

However, the process of within-host de novo mutant generation and evolutionary selection that underlies these antigenic sweeps is poorly understood. Here, we investigate mutational patterns between evolutionarily closely related human seasonal influenza viruses using host age as a proxy for immune experience.
