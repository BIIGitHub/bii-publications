One important defense strategy is the ability to export drugs by multidrug transporters. One class of multidrug transporter, the so-called multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters, extrude a variety of antibiotic compounds from the bacterial cytoplasm."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Zachariae U","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/zachariae-u","nextPagePath":"/author/zachariae-u/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
