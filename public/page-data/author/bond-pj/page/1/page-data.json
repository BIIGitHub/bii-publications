The mycobacterial enzyme is also unique as a result of its 111 amino acids extended δ subunit, whose gene is fused to the peripheral stalk subunit b. Recently, the crystallographic structures of the mycobacterial α3:β3:γ:ε-domain and c subunit ring were resolved.

Here, we perform structure and interaction mapping on four DENV and ZIKV strains inside virions and in infected cells. Comparative analysis of SHAPE reactivities across serotypes nominates potentially functional regions that are highly structured, conserved, and contain low synonymous mutation rates.

They pump protons against an ion gradient, driven by a mechano-chemical framework that exploits ATP hydrolysis as an energy source. This process drives the rotation of the so-called c-ring, a membrane embedded complex in the Vo-domain of the V-type ATPase, resulting in translocation of protons across the membrane. One way in which the enzyme is regulated is by disassembly and reassembly of the V1-domain with the Vo-domain, which inactivates and reactivates the enzyme, respectively.

Their suggested functions are in membrane stabilization and cell protection. All dehydrins contain at least one copy of the highly conserved K-segment, proposed to be a membrane binding motif.

Dengue is responsible for an estimated 390 million infections per year, with dengue 2 (DENV2) being the most virulent strain among the four serotypes. Interestingly, it is also in strains of this serotype that temperature-dependent large-scale morphological changes, termed “breathing,” have been observed.

Genetic duplication processes give rise to sets of regulatory proteins that have evolved from a common ancestor, leading to interactomes whose dysregulation is often associated with disease. A better understanding of the determinants of specificity at 21 interfaces shared by functionally related proteins is crucial to the rational design of novel pharmacotherapeutic agents.
