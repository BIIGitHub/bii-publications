The transcription factor SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in solid tumor and leukemia cells. We developed a screen to identify compounds that reduce the viability of liver cancer cells that express high levels of SALL4, and we investigated their mechanisms."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-16-genomics-driven-discovery-of-a-biosynthetic-gene-cluster-required-for-the-synthesis-of-bii-rafflesfungin-from-the-fungus-phoma-sp-f3723/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Genomics-driven discovery of a biosynthetic gene cluster required for the synthesis of BII-Rafflesfungin from the fungus Phoma sp.
