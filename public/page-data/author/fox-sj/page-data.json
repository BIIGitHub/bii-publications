Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are routinely used to probe such interactions. However, detailed analyses and interpretation of the hydration patterns seen in MD simulations can be both complex and time-consuming.

There is a clear need for rigorous methods to predict the likelihood of specific drug-resistance mutations arising in response to the binding of a drug. In this work we attempt to develop a robust computational protocol for predicting drug resistant mutations at the gatekeeper position (T790) in EGFR.
