As a safe, higher-throughput alternative, we explore the possibility of using readily available passage bias data obtained mostly from seasonal H1 and H3 influenza strains that were differentially grown in mammalian (MDCK) and avian cells (eggs)."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-the-geographic-variation-of-surveillance-and-zoonotic-spillover-potential-of-influenza-viruses-in-domestic-poultry-and-swine/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Geographic Variation of Surveillance and Zoonotic Spillover Potential of Influenza Viruses in Domestic Poultry and Swine","date":"2018-11-27T06:37:02.553Z","categories":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Gene Function Prediction","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"description":"Background\nAvian and swine influenza viruses circulate worldwide and pose threats to both animal and human health.
