Here, we report tailored GDNF signaling using synthetic polyproline-based GAG mimetics (PGMs).

Genetic duplication processes give rise to sets of regulatory proteins that have evolved from a common ancestor, leading to interactomes whose dysregulation is often associated with disease. A better understanding of the determinants of specificity at 21 interfaces shared by functionally related proteins is crucial to the rational design of novel pharmacotherapeutic agents.

The HK EnvZ is a global sensor of osmolality and cellular acid pH. In previous studies, we discovered that osmosensing in EnvZ was mediated through osmolyte-induced stabilization of the partially disordered helical backbone spanning the conserved histidine autophosphorylation site (His243)."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Huber RG","currentPage":1,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":8,"prevPagePath":"/author/huber-rg","nextPagePath":"/author/huber-rg/page/2","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":false}}}
