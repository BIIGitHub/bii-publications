Here we apply two superresolution microscopy techniques, specifically 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), a type of single molecule localisation microscopy, to localise IRSp53 protein and its I-BAR domain in relation to F-actin within filopodia."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Hariharan S","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/author/hariharan-s","nextPagePath":"/author/hariharan-s/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
