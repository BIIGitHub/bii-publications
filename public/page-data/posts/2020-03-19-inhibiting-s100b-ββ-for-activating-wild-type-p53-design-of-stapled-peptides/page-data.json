S100B(ββ) directly interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, inhibiting tetramerization and protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation, consequently decreasing p53 DNA binding and transcriptional activity, and preventing apoptosis. Thus, S100B(ββ) is being pursued as a target for therapeutic inhibition.<br>\nHowever, development of small molecule inhibitors targeting p53-interactions has met with limited success. In this work, we present a set of designed stapled peptide inhibitors of S100B(ββ), guided by the structure of the C-terminal domain of p53 complexed with S100B(ββ). We further modified a tightly binding stapled peptide with imaging agents and propose these as potential diagnostic agents to detect S100B(ββ) as a biomarker.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-19-inhibiting-s100b-ββ-for-activating-wild-type-p53-design-of-stapled-peptides/","categorySlugs":["/group/atomistic-simulations-and-design-in-biology/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"tagSlugs":["/author/kannan-s/","/author/aronica-p/","/author/tan-ys/","/author/verma-cs/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-03-14T09:41:16.607Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"S100B(ββ) is a member of the S100B protein family and is distributed in a cell-specific manner.
