We investigated this through molecular modeling and simulations of the S209 phosphorylated derivative of eIF4E and explored the associated implication on the binding of the different variants of mRNA‐cap analogs. A key feature that emerges as a result of eIF4E phosphorylation is a salt‐bridge network between the phosphorylated S209 (pS209) and a specific pair of lysine residues (K159 and K162) within the cap‐binding interface on eIF4E. This interaction linkage stabilizes the otherwise dynamic C‐terminal region of the protein, resulting in the attenuation of the overall plasticity and accessibility of the binding pocket. The pS209‐K159 salt‐bridge also results in an energetically less favorable environment for the bound mRNA‐cap primarily due to electrostatic repulsion between the negative potentials from the phosphates in the cap and those appearing as a result of phosphorylation of S209. These observations collectively imply that the binding of the mRNA‐cap will be adversely affected in the phosphorylated derivative of eIF4E. We propose a mechanistic model highlighting the role of eIF4E phosphorylation as a regulatory tool in modulating eIF4E: mRNA‐cap recognition and its potential impact on translation initiation.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-09-deciphering-the-mechanistic-effects-of-eif4e-phosphorylation-on-mrna‐cap-recognition/","categorySlugs":["/group/atomistic-simulations-and-design-in-biology/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"tagSlugs":["/author/lama-d/","/author/verma-cs/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-12-06T09:16:02.576Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"The mRNA cap‐binding oncoprotein “eIF4E” is phosphorylated at residue S209 by Mnk kinases, and is closely associated with tumor development and progression.
