A better understanding of the determinants of specificity at 21 interfaces shared by functionally related proteins is crucial to the rational design of novel pharmacotherapeutic agents. To this end, a comprehensive dataset of drug and drug-like binders was assembled for the Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins â€“ archetypal examples of regulatory systems governed by evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions. These were first used to derive a two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D QSAR) model, predicting ligand specificity for these homologous proteins. The strengths and weaknesses of high-throughput 2D QSAR were then compared and contrasted to those of theoretically rigorous thermodynamic integration calculations performed on 14 complexes of Bcl-xL-specific, Bcl-2-specific, and potent dual binders bound to the Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 proteins. We demonstrate that free energy calculations provide an added layer of essential information, which traditional QSAR cannot capture. Moreover, we show that protein energetic responses to different ligands, expressed as per-residue energy values, can be used to fingerprint the protein-ligand interaction, extending the framework of four-dimensional molecular dynamics/quantitative structure-activity relationships (4D-MD/QSAR) towards the facilitation of future drug design strategies.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-energetic-fingerprinting-of-ligand-binding-to-paralogous-proteins-the-case-of-the-apoptotic-pathway/","categorySlugs":["/group/multiscale-simulation-modelling-and-design/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"tagSlugs":["/author/ivanov-sm/","/author/huber-rg/","/author/alibay-i/","/author/warwicker-j/","/author/bond-pj/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-12-24T03:55:24.281Z","categories":["Multiscale Simulation, Modelling and Design","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Networks of biological molecules are key to cellular function, governing processes ranging from signal cascade propagation to metabolic pathway regulation.
