The FAO/WHO guidelines for computational assessment of allergenic potential of proteins based on short peptide hits and linear sequence window identity thresholds misclassify many proteins as allergens.</p>\n<p>RESULTS:<br>\nWe developed AllerCatPro which predicts the allergenic potential of proteins based on similarity of their 3D protein structure as well as their amino acid sequence compared to a dataset of known protein allergens comprising of 4180 unique allergenic protein sequences derived from the union of the major databases FARRP, COMPARE, WHO/IUIS, UniProtKB and Allergome. We extended the hexamer hit rule by removing peptides with high probability of random occurrence measured by sequence entropy as well as requiring 3 or more hexamer hits consistent with natural linear epitope patterns in known allergens. This is complemented with a Gluten-like repeat pattern detection. We also switched from a linear sequence window similarity to a B cell epitope-like 3D surface similarity window which became possible through extensive 3D structure modelling covering the majority (74%) of allergens. In case no structure similarity is found, the decision workflow reverts to the old linear sequence window rule. The overall accuracy of AllerCatPro is 84% compared to other current methods which range from 51 to 73%. Both the FAO/WHO rules and AllerCatPro achieve highest sensitivity but AllerCatPro provides a 37-fold increase in specificity.</p>\n<p>AVAILABILITY:<br>\n<a href=\"https://allercatpro.bii.a-star.edu.sg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://allercatpro.bii.a-star.edu.sg/</a>.</p>\n<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:<br>\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-allercatpro-prediction-of-protein-allergenicity-potential-from-the-protein-sequence/","categorySlugs":["/group/gene-function-prediction/","/group/protein-sequence-analysis/","/group/biomolecular-function-discovery-division/"],"tagSlugs":["/author/maurer-stroh-s/","/author/krutz-nl/","/author/kern-ps/","/author/gunalan-v/","/author/nguyen-mn/","/author/limviphuvadh-v/","/author/eisenhaber-f/","/author/gerberick-gf/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-01-18T03:29:06.199Z","categories":["Gene Function Prediction","Protein Sequence Analysis","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"description":"MOTIVATION:\nDue to the risk of inducing an immediate type I (IgE-mediated) allergic response, proteins intended for use in consumer products must be investigated for their allergenic potential before introduction into the marketplace.
