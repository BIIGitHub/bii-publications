The mycobacterial enzyme is also unique as a result of its 111 amino acids extended δ subunit, whose gene is fused to the peripheral stalk subunit b. Recently, the crystallographic structures of the mycobacterial α3:β3:γ:ε-domain and c subunit ring were resolved. Here, we report the first purification protocol of the intact M. smegmatis F1FO ATP synthase including the F1-domain, the entire membrane-embedded FO sector, and the stator subunits b’ and the fused b-δ. This enzyme purification enabled the determination of the first projected 2D- and 3D structure of the intact M. smegmatis F1FO ATP synthase by electron microscopy (EM) and single particle analysis. Expression and purification of the fused mycobacterial b-δ24-446 construct, excluding the membrane-embedded N-terminal amino acids, provided insight into its secondary structure. By combining these data with homology and ab-initio modeling techniques, a model of the mycobacterial peripheral stalk subunits b-δ and b’ was generated. Superposition of the 3D M. smegmatis F-ATP synthase EM-structure, the α3:β3:γ:ε and c-ring, and the derived structural models of the peripheral stalk enabled a clear assignment of all F-ATP synthase subunits, in particular with respect to the unique mycobacterial peripheral stalk subunit b’ and the elongated δ fused with subunit b. The arrangement of δ relative to the N-termini of the catalytic α3β3-headpiece and its potential as a drug target are discussed.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-16-structure-and-subunit-arrangement-of-mycobacterial-f1fo-atp-synthase-and-novel-features-of-the-unique-mycobacterial-subunit-δ/","categorySlugs":["/group/function-and-structure-of-rna/","/group/biomolecular-function-discovery-division/","/group/multiscale-simulation-modelling-and-design/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"tagSlugs":["/author/kamariah-n/","/author/huber-rg/","/author/nartey-w/","/author/bhushan-s/","/author/bond-pj/","/author/gruber-g/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-05-24T06:39:52.758Z","categories":["Function and Structure of RNA","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division ","Multiscale Simulation, Modelling and Design","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"In contrast to other prokaryotes, the Mycobacterial F1FO ATP synthase (α3:β3:γ:δ:ε:a:b:b':c9) is essential for growth.
