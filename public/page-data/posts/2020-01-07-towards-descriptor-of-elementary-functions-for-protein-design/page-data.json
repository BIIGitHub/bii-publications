Closed loops and elementary functional loops, which are descendants of ancient ring-like peptides that formed fist protein domains in agreement with Dayhoff’s hypothesis, can be considered as basic units of protein structure and function. We argue that future developments in protein design approaches should consider descriptors of the elementary functions, which will help to complement designed scaffolds with functional signatures and flexibility necessary for their functions.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-07-towards-descriptor-of-elementary-functions-for-protein-design/","categorySlugs":["/group/physics-and-evolution-of-biological-macromolecules/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"tagSlugs":["/author/berezovsky-in/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-07-25T07:25:31.263Z","categories":["Physics and Evolution of Biological Macromolecules","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"We review studies of the protein evolution that help to formulate rules for protein design.
