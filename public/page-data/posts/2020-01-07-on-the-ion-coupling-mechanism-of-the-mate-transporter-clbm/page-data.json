One important defense strategy is the ability to export drugs by multidrug transporters. One class of multidrug transporter, the so-called multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters, extrude a variety of antibiotic compounds from the bacterial cytoplasm. These MATE transporters are driven by a Na+, H+, or combined Na+/H+ gradient, and act as antiporters to drive a conformational change in the transporter from the outward to the inward-facing conformation. In the inward-facing conformation, a chemical compound (drug) binds to the protein, resulting in a switch to the opposite conformation, thereby extruding the drug. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we now report the structural basis for Na+ and H+ binding in the dual ion coupled MATE transporter ClbM from Escherichia coli, which is connected to colibactin-induced genotoxicity, yielding novel insights into the ion/drug translocation mechanism of this bacterial transporter.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-07-on-the-ion-coupling-mechanism-of-the-mate-transporter-clbm/","categorySlugs":["/group/function-and-structure-of-rna/","/group/biomolecular-function-discovery-division/","/group/multiscale-simulation-modelling-and-design/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"tagSlugs":["/author/krah-a/","/author/huber-rg/","/author/zachariae-u/","/author/bond-pj/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-11-28T05:44:38.834Z","categories":["Function and Structure of RNA","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division ","Multiscale Simulation, Modelling and Design","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Bacteria use a number of mechanisms to defend themselves from antimicrobial drugs.
