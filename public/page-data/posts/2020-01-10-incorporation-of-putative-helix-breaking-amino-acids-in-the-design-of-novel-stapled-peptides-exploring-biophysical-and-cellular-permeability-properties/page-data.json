As a model system for probing the chemical space available for optimizing these properties, we focused on dual Mdm2/MdmX antagonist stapled peptides related to the p53 N-terminus. Specifically, we first generated a library of ATSP-7041 (Chang et al., 2013) analogs iteratively modified by L-Ala and D-amino acids. Single L-Ala substitutions beyond the Mdm2/(X) binding interfacial residues (i.e., Phe3, Trp7, and Cba10) had minimal effects on target binding, α-helical content, and cellular activity. Similar binding affinities and cellular activities were noted at non-interfacial positions when the template residues were substituted with their d-amino acid counterparts, despite the fact that d-amino acid residues typically ‘break’ right-handed α-helices. d-amino acid substitutions at the interfacial residues Phe3 and Cba10 resulted in the expected decreases in binding affinity and cellular activity. Surprisingly, substitution at the remaining interfacial position with its d-amino acid equivalent (i.e., Trp7 to d-Trp7) was fully tolerated, both in terms of its binding affinity and cellular activity. An X-ray structure of the d-Trp7-modified peptide was determined and revealed that the indole side chain was able to interact optimally with its Mdm2 binding site by a slight global re-orientation of the stapled peptide. To further investigate the comparative effects of d-amino acid substitutions we used linear analogs of ATSP-7041, where we replaced the stapling amino acids by Aib (i.e., R84 to Aib4 and S511 to Aib11) to retain the helix-inducing properties of α-methylation. The resultant analog sequence Ac–Leu–Thr–Phe–Aib–Glu–Tyr–Trp–Gln–Leu–Cba–Aib–Ser–Ala–Ala–NH2 exhibited high-affinity target binding (Mdm2 Kd = 43 nM) and significant α-helicity in circular dichroism studies. Relative to this linear ATSP-7041 analog, several d-amino acid substitutions at Mdm2(X) non-binding residues (e.g., d-Glu5, d-Gln8, and d-Leu9) demonstrated decreased binding and α-helicity. Importantly, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy showed that although helicity was indeed disrupted by d-amino acids in linear versions of our template sequence, stapled molecules tolerated these residues well. Further studies on stapled peptides incorporating N-methylated amino acids, l-Pro, or Gly substitutions showed that despite some positional dependence, these helix-breaking residues were also generally tolerated in terms of secondary structure, binding affinity, and cellular activity. Overall, macrocyclization by hydrocarbon stapling appears to overcome the destabilization of α-helicity by helix breaking residues and, in the specific case of d-Trp7-modification, a highly potent ATSP-7041 analog (Mdm2 Kd = 30 nM; cellular EC50 = 600 nM) was identified. Our findings provide incentive for future studies to expand the chemical diversity of macrocyclic α-helical peptides (e.g., d-amino acid modifications) to explore their biophysical properties and cellular permeability. Indeed, using the library of 50 peptides generated in this study, a good correlation between cellular permeability and lipophilicity was observed.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-10-incorporation-of-putative-helix-breaking-amino-acids-in-the-design-of-novel-stapled-peptides-exploring-biophysical-and-cellular-permeability-properties/","categorySlugs":["/group/atomistic-simulations-and-design-in-biology/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"tagSlugs":["/author/partridge-aw/","/author/kaan-hyk/","/author/juang-yc/","/author/sadruddin-a/","/author/lim-s/","/author/brown-cj/","/author/ng-s/","/author/thean-d/","/author/ferrer-f/","/author/johannes-c/","/author/yuen-ty/","/author/kannan-s/","/author/aronica-p/","/author/tan-ys/","/author/pradhan-mr/","/author/verma-cs/","/author/hochman-j/","/author/chen-s/","/author/wan-h/","/author/ha-s/","/author/sherborne-b/","/author/lane-dp/","/author/sawyer-tk/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-06-20T05:52:29.396Z","categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Stapled α-helical peptides represent an emerging superclass of macrocyclic molecules with drug-like properties, including high-affinity target binding, protease resistance, and membrane permeability.
