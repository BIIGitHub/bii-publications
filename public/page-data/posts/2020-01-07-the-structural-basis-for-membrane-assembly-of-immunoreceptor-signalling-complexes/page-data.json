Based on > 15 μs of explicitly solvated, atomic-resolution sampling, we explore molecular aspects of immunoreceptor complex stability in different functionally relevant states. A novel alchemical approach is used to simulate the cytoplasmic CD3ε tail at different depths within lipid bilayer models, revealing that the conformation and cytoplasmic exposure of ITAMs are highly sensitive to local enrichment by different lipid species and to phosphorylation. Furthermore, simulations of the TCR and DAP12 TM domains in various states of oligomerisation suggest that, during the early stages of assembly, stable membrane insertion is facilitated by the interfacial lipid/solvent environment and/or partial ionisation of charged residues. Collectively, our results indicate that the architecture and mechanisms of signal transduction in immunoreceptor complexes are tightly regulated by interactions with the microenvironment.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-07-the-structural-basis-for-membrane-assembly-of-immunoreceptor-signalling-complexes/","categorySlugs":["/group/multiscale-simulation-modelling-and-design/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"tagSlugs":["/author/dube-n/","/author/marzinek-jk/","/author/glen-rc/","/author/bond-pj/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-08-27T06:45:08.033Z","categories":["Multiscale Simulation, Modelling and Design","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Immunoreceptors are TM complexes that consist of separate ligand-binding and signal-transducing modules.
