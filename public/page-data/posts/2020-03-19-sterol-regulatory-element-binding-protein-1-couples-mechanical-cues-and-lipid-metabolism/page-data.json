In vertebrates, SREBP activation is mainly controlled by a complex and well-characterized feedback mechanism mediated by cholesterol, a crucial bio-product of the SREBP-activated mevalonate pathway. In this work, we identified acto-myosin contractility and mechanical forces imposed by the extracellular matrix (ECM) as SREBP1 regulators. SREBP1 control by mechanical cues depends on geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, another key bio-product of the mevalonate pathway, and impacts on stem cell fate in mouse and on fat storage in Drosophila. Mechanistically, we show that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by ECM stiffening and geranylgeranylated RhoA-dependent acto-myosin contraction inhibits SREBP1 activation. Our results unveil an unpredicted and evolutionary conserved role of SREBP1 in rewiring cell metabolism in response to mechanical cues.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-19-sterol-regulatory-element-binding-protein-1-couples-mechanical-cues-and-lipid-metabolism/","categorySlugs":["/group/protein-sequence-analysis/","/group/biomolecular-function-discovery-division/"],"tagSlugs":["/author/bertolio-r/","/author/napoletano-f/","/author/mano-m/","/author/maurer-stroh-s/","/author/fantuz-m/","/author/zannini-a/","/author/bicciato-s/","/author/sorrentino-g/","/author/del-sal-g/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-03-22T09:19:56.120Z","categories":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division "],"description":"Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are a family of transcription factors that regulate lipid biosynthesis and adipogenesis by controlling the expression of several enzymes required for cholesterol, fatty acid, triacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis.","tags":["Bertolio R","Napoletano F","Mano M","Maurer-Stroh S","Fantuz M","Zannini A","Bicciato S","Sorrentino G","Del Sal G"],"title":"Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 couples mechanical cues and lipid metabolism","uploadfile":"/media/uploads/sterol-regulatory.pdf","journaltypes":"Journal Paper","journal":"Nature Communications, 2019 Mar 22;10(1):1326. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-09152-7","pubmed":"30902980","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09152-7","impactfactor":"12.353","dateofacceptance":"2019-02-25T09:19:56.152Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-19-sterol-regulatory-element-binding-protein-1-couples-mechanical-cues-and-lipid-metabolism/"}}}
