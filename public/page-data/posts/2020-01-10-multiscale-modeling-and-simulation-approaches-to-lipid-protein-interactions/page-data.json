Naturally, a large apparatus of biomolecules is responsible for construction, maintenance, transport, and degradation of these lipid barriers. Additional classes of biomolecules are tasked with transport of specific substances or transduction of signals from the environment across lipid membranes. In this article, we intend to describe a set of techniques that enable one to build accurate models of lipid systems and their associated proteins, and to simulate their dynamics over a variety of time and length scales. We discuss the methods and challenges that allow us to derive structural, mechanistic, and thermodynamic information from these models. We also show how these models have recently been applied in research to study some of the most complex lipid-protein systems to date, including bacterial and viral envelopes, neuronal membranes, and mammalian signaling systems.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-10-multiscale-modeling-and-simulation-approaches-to-lipid-protein-interactions/","categorySlugs":["/group/multiscale-simulation-modelling-and-design/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"tagSlugs":["/author/huber-rg/","/author/carpenter-ts/","/author/dube-n/","/author/holdbrook-da/","/author/ingolfsson-hi/","/author/irvine-wa/","/author/marzinek-jk/","/author/samsudin-f/","/author/allison-jr/","/author/khalid-s/","/author/bond-pj/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-06-20T05:55:37.797Z","categories":["Multiscale Simulation, Modelling and Design","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Lipid membranes play a crucial role in living systems by compartmentalizing biological processes and forming a barrier between these processes and the environment.
