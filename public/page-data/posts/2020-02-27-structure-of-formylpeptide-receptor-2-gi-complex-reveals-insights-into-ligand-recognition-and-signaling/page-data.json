In addition, FPRs, especially FPR2, can also recognize other ligands with a large chemical diversity generated at different stages of inflammation to either promote or resolve inflammation in order to maintain a balanced inflammatory response. The mechanism underlying promiscuous ligand recognition and activation of FPRs is not clear. Here we report a cryo-EM structure of FPR2-Gisignaling complex with a peptide agonist. The structure reveals a widely open extracellular region with an amphiphilic environment for ligand binding. Together with computational docking and simulation, the structure suggests a molecular basis for the recognition of formylpeptides and a potential mechanism of receptor activation, and reveals conserved and divergent features in Gicoupling. Our results provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of the functional promiscuity of FPRs.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-02-27-structure-of-formylpeptide-receptor-2-gi-complex-reveals-insights-into-ligand-recognition-and-signaling/","categorySlugs":["/group/structure-based-ligand-discovery-and-design/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"],"tagSlugs":["/author/zhuang-y/","/author/liu-h/","/author/edward-zhou-x/","/author/kumar-verma-r/","/author/de-waal-pw/","/author/jang-w/","/author/xu-th/","/author/wang-l/","/author/meng-x/","/author/zhao-g/","/author/kang-y/","/author/melcher-k/","/author/fan-h/","/author/lambert-na/","/author/eric-xu-h/","/author/zhang-c/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-02-14T02:38:00.451Z","categories":["Structure-based Ligand Discovery and Design","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Formylpeptide receptors (FPRs) as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can recognize formylpeptides derived from pathogens or host cells to function in host defense and cell clearance.
