Mono-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (MEHP) is an active metabolite of di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), a commonly used plasticizer. MEHP adversely affects human health causing hepatotoxicity and reproductive toxicity. How MEHP affects cellular physiology is not fully understood.

Allostery is rooted in the fundamental physical properties of macromolecular systems, but its underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. A collection of contributions to a recent interdisciplinary CECAM (Center Européen de Calcul Atomique et Moléculaire) workshop is used here to provide an overview of the progress and remaining limitations in the understanding of the mechanistic foundations of allostery gained from computational and experimental analyses of real protein systems and model systems. The main conceptual frameworks instrumental in driving the field are discussed. We illustrate the role of these frameworks in illuminating molecular mechanisms and explaining cellular processes, and describe some of their promising practical applications in engineering molecular sensors and informing drug design efforts.","journaltypes":"Journal Paper","journal":"Structure 27, 2019 Jan 17. pii: S0969-2126(19)30003-6. doi: 10.1016/j.str.2019.01.003","pubmed":"30744993","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744993","impactfactor":"4.907","dateofacceptance":"2019-03-31T16:00:00.000Z"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-02-27-structure-mapping-of-dengue-and-zika-viruses-reveals-functional-long-range-interactions/","categorySlugs":["/group/function-and-structure-of-rna/","/group/biomolecular-function-discovery-division/","/group/multiscale-simulation-modelling-and-design/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Structure mapping of dengue and Zika viruses reveals functional long-range interactions","date":"2019-03-29T07:30:07.749Z","categories":["Function and Structure of RNA","Biomolecular Function Discovery Division ","Multiscale Simulation, Modelling and Design","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are clinically important members of the Flaviviridae family with an 11 kb positive strand RNA genome that folds to enable virus function.
