In addition to the development of small molecules, there has been interest in developing constrained (stapled) peptide inhibitors. A stapled peptide ALRN_6924 that activates p53 by preventing its interaction with its negative regulator Mdm2 has entered clinical trials. This stapled peptide mimics the interaction of p53 with Mdm2.

Aberrant HGF/c-MET upregulation and activation is frequently observed in bladder cancer correlating with cancer progression and invasion. However, the mechanisms underlying HGF/c-MET-mediated invasion in bladder cancer remains unknown. As part of a negative feedback loop SMAD7 binds to SMURF2 targeting the TGFβ receptor for degradation. Under these conditions, SMAD7 acts as a SMURF2 agonist by disrupting the intramolecular interactions within SMURF2. We demonstrate that HGF stimulates TGFβ signalling through c-SRC-mediated phosphorylation of SMURF2 resulting in loss of SMAD7 binding and enhanced SMURF2 C2-HECT interaction, inhibiting SMURF2 and enhancing TGFβ receptor stabilisation. This upregulation of the TGFβ pathway by HGF leads to TGFβ-mediated EMT and invasion. In vivo we show that TGFβ receptor inhibition prevents bladder cancer invasion. Furthermore, we make a rationale for the use of combinatorial TGFβ and MEK inhibitors for treatment of high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers.","journaltypes":"Journal Paper","journal":"Nature Communicationsvolume 10, Article number: 4349 (2019), doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-12241-2","pubmed":"31554791 ","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12241-2#Sec1","impactfactor":"11.878","dateofacceptance":"2019-08-27T06:08:40.817Z"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"currentPage":1,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":8,"prevPagePath":"/","nextPagePath":"/page/2","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":true}}}
