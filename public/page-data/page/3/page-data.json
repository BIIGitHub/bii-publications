Mounting evidence suggests that interactions with the local environment may influence the architecture of these TM domains, which assemble via crucial sets of conserved ionisable residues, and also control the peripheral association of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) whose phosphorylation triggers cytoplasmic signalling cascades. We now report a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of the archetypal T cell receptor (TCR) and its cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) signalling partners, along with the analogous DNAX-activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12)/natural killer group 2C (NKG2C) complex.

However, the real cost of such a study goes beyond sequencing or data generation in general (Muir et al., 2016); the amount of raw sequencing data per sample can be quite sizable and quickly amass to quite a collection even for a modest cohort in contrast to the array based technology that it has inevitably displaced.","journaltypes":"Journal Paper","journal":"Journal of Open Source Software, 2019, 4(40), 1533, DOI: 10.21105/joss.01533","pubmed":null,"url":"https://joss.theoj.org/papers/3c5651fb27f0f08d37fc17a2bc31cfee","impactfactor":"1.01","dateofacceptance":"2019-08-03T07:20:58.646Z"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-07-regulation-of-flagellar-motor-switching-by-c-di-gmp-phosphodiesterases-in-pseudomonas-aeruginosa/","categorySlugs":["/group/biophysical-modelling/","/group/imaging-informatics-division/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Regulation of flagellar motor switching by c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa","date":"2019-07-26T07:23:10.561Z","categories":["Biophysical Modelling","Imaging Informatics Division"],"description":"The second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) plays a prominent role in regulating flagellum-dependent motility in the single-flagellated pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The c-di-GMP–mediated signaling pathways and mechanisms that control flagellar output remain to be fully unveiled. Studying surface-tethered and free-swimming P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells, we found that the overexpression of an exogenous diguanylate cyclase (DGC) raises the global cellular c-di-GMP concentration and thereby inhibits flagellar motor switching and decreases motor speed, reducing swimming speed and reversal frequency, respectively.
