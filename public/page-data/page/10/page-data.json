The FAO/WHO guidelines for computational assessment of allergenic potential of proteins based on short peptide hits and linear sequence window identity thresholds misclassify many proteins as allergens.","journaltypes":"Journal Paper","journal":"Bioinformatics. 2019 Jan 18. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btz029","pubmed":"30657872 ","url":"https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz029/5292313","impactfactor":"5.481","dateofacceptance":"2019-01-14T03:29:06.221Z"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-20-organic-cation-transporter-3-oct3-is-a-distinct-catecholamines-clearance-route-in-adipocytes-mediating-the-beiging-of-white-adipose-tissue/","categorySlugs":["/group/structure-based-ligand-discovery-and-design/","/group/biomolecular-modelling-and-design-division/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3) is a distinct catecholamines clearance route in adipocytes mediating the beiging of white adipose tissue","date":"2019-01-17T03:34:14.278Z","categories":["Structure-based Ligand Discovery and Design","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"],"description":"Beiging of white adipose tissue (WAT) is a particularly appealing target for therapeutics in the treatment of metabolic diseases through norepinephrine (NE)-mediated signaling pathways.

A subset of these mutations lowers the unfolding temperature of the DBD.

However, increasing evidence now shows that biological systems cannot be simply considered as the sum of its parts.

A Markov process describes the random walk of a traveling probe in the corresponding energy landscape, mimicking the motion of a biomolecule involved in chromatin function. By studying the metastability of the associated Markov State Model upon annealing, the hierarchical structure of individual chromosomes is observed, and corresponding set of structural partitions is identified at each level of hierarchy.
