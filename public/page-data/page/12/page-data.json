The elderly are often stratified according to frailty status where frail individuals are more susceptible to adverse health outcomes than their non-frail counterparts, however, it is not known whether immunity induced by influenza vaccination is impaired in the frail elderly.","journaltypes":"Journal Paper","journal":"Frontiers in Immunology, 24 Oct 2018, Vol. 9, Article 265, doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02465","pubmed":"30405641","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6207627/","impactfactor":"5.511","dateofacceptance":"2018-10-04T06:46:03.972Z"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-03-25-commentary-augmented-reality-scientific-phone-apps-making-the-apd-ar-holistic-review-app-and-using-existing-ar-apps-for-scientific-publications/","categorySlugs":["/group/antibody-and-product-development/","/group/translational-research-division/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Commentary: Augmented Reality Scientific Phone Apps - making the APD AR Holistic Review app and using existing AR apps for scientific publications","date":"2018-10-02T06:54:24.168Z","categories":["Antibody and Product Development","Translational Research Division"],"description":"The average scientific publication is not the most palatable of reading materials, especially to those not in the relevant disciplines.
