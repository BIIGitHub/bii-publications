The use of phylogenetics to identify and differentiate between clusters of genetically similar pathogens is particularly prevalent in virology from the nomenclature of human papillomaviruses to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5Nx viruses. These nomenclature systems rely on absolute genetic distance thresholds to define the maximum genetic divergence tolerated between viruses designated as closely related.

A Y340A mutation reduced ADP-dependent oligomer formation using a gel filtration assay, suggesting that Y340 forms a dominant oligomer stabilizing side chain.

They pump protons against an ion gradient, driven by a mechano-chemical framework that exploits ATP hydrolysis as an energy source. This process drives the rotation of the so-called c-ring, a membrane embedded complex in the Vo-domain of the V-type ATPase, resulting in translocation of protons across the membrane. One way in which the enzyme is regulated is by disassembly and reassembly of the V1-domain with the Vo-domain, which inactivates and reactivates the enzyme, respectively.
