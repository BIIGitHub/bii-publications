TLR4 is of particular interest, since over-stimulation of its pathway by excess lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules from the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria can result in sepsis, which causes millions of deaths each year. In this review, we outline our use of molecular simulation approaches to gain a better understanding of the determinants of LPS recognition, towards the search for novel immunotherapeutics.

Using structure-based statistical mechanical model of allostery and analyzing energetics of the effects of mutations in a set of 27 proteins with at least 50 pathological SNPs in each molecule, we found that, indeed, some SNPs can work allosterically.
