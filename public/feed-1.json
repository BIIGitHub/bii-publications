Aberrant HGF/c-MET upregulation and activation is frequently observed in bladder cancer correlating with cancer progression and invasion. However, the mechanisms underlying HGF/c-MET-mediated invasion in bladder cancer remains unknown. As part of a negative feedback loop SMAD7 binds to SMURF2 targeting the TGFβ receptor for degradation. Under these conditions, SMAD7 acts as a SMURF2 agonist by disrupting the intramolecular interactions within SMURF2. We demonstrate that HGF stimulates TGFβ signalling through c-SRC-mediated phosphorylation of SMURF2 resulting in loss of SMAD7 binding and enhanced SMURF2 C2-HECT interaction, inhibiting SMURF2 and enhancing TGFβ receptor stabilisation. This upregulation of the TGFβ pathway by HGF leads to TGFβ-mediated EMT and invasion. In vivo we show that TGFβ receptor inhibition prevents bladder cancer invasion. Furthermore, we make a rationale for the use of combinatorial TGFβ and MEK inhibitors for treatment of high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers.","tags":["Sim WJ","Iyengar PV","Lama D","Lui SKL","Ng HC","Haviv-Shapira L","Domany E","Kappei D","Tan TZ","Saei A","Jaynes PW","Verma CS","Kumar AP","Rouanne M","Ha HK","Radulescu C","Ten Dijke P","Eichhorn PJA","Thiery JP"],"categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"]},{"path":"/posts/2020-01-07-braf-inhibitors-promote-intermediate-braf-v600e-conformations-and-binary-interactions-with-activated-ras/","title":"BRAF inhibitors promote intermediate BRAF(V600E) conformations and binary interactions with activated RAS","date":"2019-09-14T06:26:20.251Z","journaltypes":"Journal Paper","journal":"Science Advances, 14 Aug 2019, Vol. 5, no. 8, doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aav8463","pubmed":"31453322","url":"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaav8463.full","impactfactor":"1.15","dateofacceptance":"2019-09-14T06:26:20.269Z","description":"Oncogenic BRAF mutations initiate tumor formation by unleashing the autoinhibited kinase conformation and promoting RAS-decoupled proliferative RAF-MEK-ERK signaling.

Mounting evidence suggests that interactions with the local environment may influence the architecture of these TM domains, which assemble via crucial sets of conserved ionisable residues, and also control the peripheral association of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) whose phosphorylation triggers cytoplasmic signalling cascades. We now report a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of the archetypal T cell receptor (TCR) and its cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) signalling partners, along with the analogous DNAX-activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12)/natural killer group 2C (NKG2C) complex.

The cement proteins (CPs) have previously been identified and sequenced. However, the molecular mechanisms of adhesion are not well understood, in particular, because the three-dimensional molecular structure of CPs remained unknown to date. Here, we conducted multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of recombinant Megabalanus rosa Cement Protein 20 (rMrCP20).
