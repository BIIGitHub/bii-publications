Aberrant HGF/c-MET upregulation and activation is frequently observed in bladder cancer correlating with cancer progression and invasion. However, the mechanisms underlying HGF/c-MET-mediated invasion in bladder cancer remains unknown. As part of a negative feedback loop SMAD7 binds to SMURF2 targeting the TGFβ receptor for degradation. Under these conditions, SMAD7 acts as a SMURF2 agonist by disrupting the intramolecular interactions within SMURF2. We demonstrate that HGF stimulates TGFβ signalling through c-SRC-mediated phosphorylation of SMURF2 resulting in loss of SMAD7 binding and enhanced SMURF2 C2-HECT interaction, inhibiting SMURF2 and enhancing TGFβ receptor stabilisation. This upregulation of the TGFβ pathway by HGF leads to TGFβ-mediated EMT and invasion. In vivo we show that TGFβ receptor inhibition prevents bladder cancer invasion. Furthermore, we make a rationale for the use of combinatorial TGFβ and MEK inhibitors for treatment of high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers.","tags":["Sim WJ","Iyengar PV","Lama D","Lui SKL","Ng HC","Haviv-Shapira L","Domany E","Kappei D","Tan TZ","Saei A","Jaynes PW","Verma CS","Kumar AP","Rouanne M","Ha HK","Radulescu C","Ten Dijke P","Eichhorn PJA","Thiery JP"],"categories":["Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology","Biomolecular Modelling and Design Division"]},{"path":"/posts/2020-01-07-development-and-application-of-a-transcriptional-sensor-for-detection-of-heterologous-acrylic-acid-production-in-e-coli/","title":"Development and application of a transcriptional sensor for detection of heterologous acrylic acid production in E. coli","date":"2019-08-19T06:55:12.440Z","journaltypes":"Journal Paper","journal":"Microbial Cell Factories, 2019, 18:139, doi: 10.1186/s1293","pubmed":"31426802","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2Fs12934-019-1185-y","impactfactor":"4.402","dateofacceptance":"2019-08-03T06:55:12.450Z","description":"Background\nAcrylic acid (AA) is a widely used commodity chemical derived from non-renewable fossil fuel sources.
