The cement proteins (CPs) have previously been identified and sequenced. However,  the molecular mechanisms of adhesion are not well understood, in particular,  because the three-dimensional molecular structure of CPs remained unknown to date.  Here, we conducted multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies and  molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of recombinant Megabalanus rosa Cement Protein  20 (rMrCP20).
