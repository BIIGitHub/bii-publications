### Hypothesis

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) represent a novel platform for cellular delivery of therapeutic [peptides](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/peptides "Learn more about peptides from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Chemically-functionalized CNTs may enhance peptide uptake by improving their membrane targeting properties.

### Experiments

Using coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigate membrane interactions of a peptide conjugated to pristine and chemically-modified CNTs. As proof of principle, we focus on their interactions with PM2, an amphipathic stapled peptide that inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2 from negatively regulating the p53 tumor [suppressor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/suppressors "Learn more about suppressor from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). CNT interaction with both simple planar [lipid bilayers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/lipid-bilayers "Learn more about lipid bilayers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") as well as spherical lipid vesicles was studied, the latter as a surrogate for curved cellular membranes.

### Findings

Membrane permeation was rapid and spontaneous for both pristine and oxidized CNTs when unconjugated. This was slowed upon addition of a noncovalently attached peptide surface “sheath”, which may be an effective way to slow CNT entry and avert membrane rupture. The CNT conjugates were observed to “desheath” their peptide layer at the bilayer interface upon insertion, leaving their cargo behind in the outer leaflet. This suggests that a synergy may exist to optimize CNT safety whilst enhancing the delivery efficiency of “hitchhiking” therapeutic molecules.
