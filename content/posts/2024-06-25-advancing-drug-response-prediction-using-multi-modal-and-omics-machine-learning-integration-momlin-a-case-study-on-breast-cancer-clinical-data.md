The inherent heterogeneity of cancer contributes to highly variable responses to any anticancer treatments. This underscores the need to first identify precise biomarkers through complex multi-omics datasets that are now available. Although much research has focused on this aspect, identifying biomarkers associated with distinct drug responders still remains a major challenge. Here, we develop MOMLIN, a multi-modal and -omics machine learning integration framework, to enhance drug-response prediction. MOMLIN jointly utilizes sparse correlation algorithms and class–specific feature selection algorithms, which identifies multi-modal and -omics–associated interpretable components. MOMLIN was applied to 147 patients’ breast cancer datasets (clinical, mutation, gene expression, tumor microenvironment cells and molecular pathways) to analyze drug-response class predictions for non-responders and variable responders. Notably, MOMLIN achieves an average AUC of 0.989, which is at least 10% greater when compared with current state-of-the-art (data integration analysis for biomarker discovery using latent components, multi-omics factor analysis, sparse canonical correlation analysis). Moreover, MOMLIN not only detects known individual biomarkers such as genes at mutation/expression level, most importantly, it correlates multi-modal and -omics network biomarkers for each response class. For example, an interaction between ER-negative-HMCN1-COL5A1 mutations-FBXO2-CSF3R expression-CD8 emerge as a multimodal biomarker for responders, potentially affecting antimicrobial peptides and FLT3 signaling pathways. In contrast, for resistance cases, a distinct combination of lymph node-TP53 mutation-PON3-ENSG00000261116 lncRNA expression-HLA-E-T-cell exclusions emerged as multimodal biomarkers, possibly impacting neurotransmitter release cycle pathway. MOMLIN, therefore, is expected advance precision medicine, such as to detect context–specific multi-omics network biomarkers and better predict drug-response classifications.
