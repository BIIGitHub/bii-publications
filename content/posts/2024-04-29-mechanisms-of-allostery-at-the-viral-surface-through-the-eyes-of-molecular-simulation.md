description: The outermost surface layer of any virus is formed by either a
  capsid shell or envelope. Such layers have traditionally been thought of as
  immovable structures, but it is becoming apparent that they cannot be viewed
  exclusively as static architectures protecting the viral genome. A limited
  number of proteins on the virion surface must perform a multitude of functions
  in order to orchestrate the viral life cycle, and allostery can regulate their
  structures at multiple levels of organization, spanning individual molecules,
  protomers, large oligomeric assemblies, or entire viral surfaces. Here, we
  review recent contributions from the molecular simulation field to viral
  surface allostery, with a particular focus on the trimeric spike glycoprotein
  emerging from the coronavirus surface, and the icosahedral flaviviral envelope
  complex. As emerging viral pathogens continue to pose a global threat, an
  improved understanding of viral dynamics and allosteric regulation will prove
  crucial in developing novel therapeutic strategies.
