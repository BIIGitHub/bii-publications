description: The growing fraction of the elderly (> 65 years) among the total
  population (from ~ 10% worldwide (above 20% in first world countries) in 2020
  to extrapolated 16% in 2050), as well as their increasing life expectancy
  (by ~ 10 years since 1960 in first world countries), confronts the world with
  increasingly difficult problems [1, 2]. Besides generally reducing life
  activity, aging remains the greatest risk factor for the development of
  chronic diseases that, subsequently, compromise independent human life and
  finally lead to death [3,4,5,6,7]. The current medical approaches to prevent
  age-related pathologies are recommendations for a healthy lifestyle, including
  exercise and diet. However, these interventions alone are not sufficient to
  prevent the onset of age-related diseases.

Although aging is the biggest risk factor for human chronic (cancer, diabetic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative) diseases, few interventions are known besides caloric restriction and a small number of drugs (with substantial side effects) that directly address aging. Thus, there is an urgent need for new options that can generally delay aging processes and prevent age-related diseases. Cellular aging is at the basis of aging processes. Chronological lifespan (CLS) of yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is the well-established model system for investigating the interventions of human post-mitotic cellular aging. CLS is defined as the number of days cells remain viable in a stationary phase. We developed a new, cheap, and fast quantitative method for measuring CLS in cell cultures incubated together with various chemical agents and controls on 96-well plates. Our PICLS protocol with (1) the use of propidium iodide for fluorescent-based cell survival reading in a microplate reader and (2) total cell count measurement via OD600nm absorption from the same plate provides real high-throughput capacity. Depending on logistics, large numbers of plates can be processed in parallel so that the screening of thousands of compounds becomes feasible in a short time. The method was validated by measuring the effect of rapamycin and calorie restriction on yeast CLS. We utilized this approach for chemical agent screening. We discovered the anti-aging/geroprotective potential of 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol (2,5-AM) and suggest its usage individually or in combination with other anti-aging interventions.
