description: This study draws on a large longitudinal cohort to demonstrate that
  adversity experienced prenatally or during early childhood, as well as
  adversity experienced by the mother during her childhood, impacts the gut
  microbiome of second-generation children at 2 y old. Notably, some of the
  microbiome profiles linked to these types of adversity, especially at higher
  taxonomic levels, were similar to those associated with the child’s current
  and future socioemotional functioning. Additionally, microbes uniquely
  associated with adversity exposures or socioemotional functioning have similar
  immune-related functions within the gut, highlighting the need for further
  research into how generational adversity affects the gut microbiome’s
  functional potential.

Adversity exposures in the prenatal and postnatal period are associated with an increased risk for psychopathology, which can be perpetuated across generations. Nonhuman animal research highlights the gut microbiome as a putative biological mechanism underlying such generational risks. In a sample of 450 mother–child dyads living in Singapore, we examined associations between three distinct adversity exposures experienced across two generations—maternal childhood maltreatment, maternal prenatal anxiety, and second-generation children’s exposure to stressful life events—and the gut microbiome composition of second-generation children at 2 y of age. We found distinct differences in gut microbiome profiles linked to each adversity exposure, as well as some nonaffected microbiome features (e.g., beta diversity). Remarkably, some of the microbial taxa associated with concurrent and prospective child socioemotional functioning shared overlapping putative functions with those affected by adversity, suggesting that the intergenerational transmission of adversity may have a lasting impact on children’s mental health via alterations to gut microbiome functions. Our findings open up a new avenue of research into the underlying mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of mental health risks and the potential of the gut microbiome as a target for intervention.
