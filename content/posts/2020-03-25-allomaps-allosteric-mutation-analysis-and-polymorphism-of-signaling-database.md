  AlloMAPS database provides data on the causality and energetics of allosteric
  communication obtained with the structure-based statistical mechanical model
  of allostery (SBSMMA). The database contains data on allosteric signaling in
  three sets of proteins and protein chains: (i) 46 proteins with
  comprehensively annotated functional and allosteric sites; (ii) 1908 protein
  chains from PDBselect set of chains with low (<25%) sequence identity; (iii)
  33 proteins with more than 50 known pathological SNPs in each molecule.

AlloMAPS database provides data on the causality and energetics of allosteric communication obtained with the structure-based statistical mechanical model of allostery (SBSMMA). The database contains data on allosteric signaling in three sets of proteins and protein chains: (i) 46 proteins with comprehensively annotated functional and allosteric sites; (ii) 1908 protein chains from PDBselect set of chains with low (<25%) sequence identity; (iii) 33 proteins with more than 50 known pathological SNPs in each molecule. In addition to energetics of allosteric signaling between known functional and regulatory sites, allosteric modulation caused by the binding to these sites, by SNPs, and by mutations designated by the user can be explored. Allosteric Signaling Maps (ASMs), which are produced via the exhaustive computational scanning for stabilizing and destabilizing mutations and for the modulation range caused by the sequence position are available for each protein/protein chain in the database. We propose to use this database for evaluating the effects of allosteric signaling in the search for latent regulatory sites and in the design of allosteric sites and effectors. The database is freely available at:[http://allomaps.bii.a-star.edu.sg](http://allomaps.bii.a-star.edu.sg/).
