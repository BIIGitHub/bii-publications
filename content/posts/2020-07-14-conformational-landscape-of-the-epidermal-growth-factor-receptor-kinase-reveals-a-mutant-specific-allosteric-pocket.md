Activating mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor (*EGFR*) kinase domain give rise to several cancers including Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Small molecule inhibitors targeted at these mutants have proven to be clinically successful drugs. These molecules are ATP competitive and rapidly result in the emergence of resistance. Recently Jia*et al.*[*Nature*, 2016,**534**, 129â€“132] reported a small molecule inhibitor (called EAI045) that binds at an allosteric pocket, does not compete with ATP and displays high potency and selectivity towards certain activating mutants (*L858R*,*T790M*,*L858R*/*T790M*) of*EGFR*, with IC50values ranging from 3 nM to 49 nM. We present here a study combining extensive molecular dynamics simulations with binding assays to provide a structural basis underlying the mechanism of binding of this molecule. It appears that in mutants, conformational destabilization of the short helix (that carries Leu858 in the wildtype), is key to the exposure of the allosteric pocket which otherwise is occluded by a set of sidechains including L858. We extend this hypothesis to show that a similar mechanism would enable the molecule to inhibit*EGFRL861Q*which is another oncogenic mutant and validate this with binding experiments. The screening of the human structural kinome revealed at least 12 other oncogenic kinases which carry at least one activating mutant in this disorder-prone region and hence would be amenable to allosteric inhibition by molecules such as EAI045. Our study characterizes a druggable allosteric pocket which appears to be specific to certain oncogenic mutants of the*EGFR*and holds therapeutic potential.
