  Neural stem cells (NCSs) are integral to establishing in vitro models and
  regenerative medicine. To this day, there is an unmet need to enrich these
  cells from a heterogeneous cell population for clinical applications without
  irreversible manipulation. We identified a method to propagate human NCSs via
  computational analysis of their mechanical signature.

Neural stem cells (NCSs) are integral to establishing in vitro models and regenerative medicine. To this day, there is an unmet need to enrich these cells from a heterogeneous cell population for clinical applications without irreversible manipulation. We identified a method to propagate human NCSs via computational analysis of their mechanical signature. In this study, we report a novel analytical method for mechanical forces in three-dimensional cultures. Further, our results revealed that stemness may, in part, be mediated by physical properties of the extracellular matrix. In conclusion, our findings have potential implications in understanding stem cell mechanobiology for enrichment or differentiation.
