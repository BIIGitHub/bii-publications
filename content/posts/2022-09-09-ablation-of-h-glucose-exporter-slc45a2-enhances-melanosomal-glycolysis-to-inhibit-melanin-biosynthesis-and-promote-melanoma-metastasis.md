description: Solute carrier transporters are the second largest family of
  membrane proteins responsible for the transport of various substances such as
  saccharides, lipids, amino acids, and inorganic ions across cellular membranes
  (Zhang et al., 2019). One third of all solute carriers such as SLC2, SLC22,
  and SLC45 subfamily belong to the major facilitator superfamily clan (Chen et
  al., 2014; Perland et al., 2017). The majority of major facilitator
  superfamily proteins are generated from a single two-transmembrane segment
  hairpin structure that triplicated to give a six two-transmembrane segment
  unit and then duplicated to a 12-two-transmembrane segment protein (Reddy et
  al., 2012). The most widely accepted working model for transporters is the
  alternating access mechanism with alternated facilitated access to binding
  sites on either side of the membrane (Diallinas, 2014).

Sequence variation in SLC45A2 are responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 4 in many species and are associated with melanoma susceptibility, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. In this study, we used Slc45a2-deficient melanocyte and mouse models to elucidate the roles of SLC45A2 in melanogenesis and melanoma metastasis. We found that the acidified cellular environment impairs the activity of key melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase in Slc45a2-deficient melanocytes. SLC45A2 is identified as a proton/glucose exporter in melanosomes, and its ablation increases the acidification of melanosomal pH through enhanced glycolysis. Intriguingly, 13C-glucose-labeled metabolic flux and biochemical assays show that melanosomes are active glucose-metabolizing organelles, indicating that elevated glycolysis mainly occurs in melanosomes owing to Slc45a2 deficiency. Moreover, Slc45a2 deficiency significantly upregulates the activities of glycolytic enzymes and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling to promote glycolysis-dependent survival and metastasis of melanoma cells. Collectively, our study reveals that the proton/glucose exporter SLC45A2 mediates melanin synthesis and melanoma metastasis primarily by modulating melanosomal glucose metabolism.
