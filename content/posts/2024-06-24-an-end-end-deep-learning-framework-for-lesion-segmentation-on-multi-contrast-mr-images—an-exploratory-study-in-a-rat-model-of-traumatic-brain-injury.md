Traumatic brain injury (TBI) engenders traumatic necrosis and penumbra-areas of secondary neural injury which are crucial targets for therapeutic interventions. Segmenting manually areas of ongoing changes like necrosis, edema, hematoma, and inflammation is tedious, error-prone, and biased. Using the multi-parametric MR data from a rodent model study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of an end-end deep learning global-attention-based UNet (GA-UNet) framework for automatic segmentation and quantification of TBI lesions. Longitudinal MR scans (2 h, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days) were performed on eight Sprague-Dawley rats after controlled cortical injury was performed. TBI lesion and sub-regions segmentation was performed using 3D-UNet and GA-UNet. Dice statistics (DSI) and Hausdorff distance were calculated to assess the performance. MR scan variations-based (bias, noise, blur, ghosting) data augmentation was performed to develop a robust model.Training/validation median DSI for U-Net was 0.9368 with T2w and MPRAGE inputs, whereas GA-UNet had 0.9537 for the same. Testing accuracies were higher for GA-UNet than U-Net with a DSI of 0.8232 for the T2w-MPRAGE inputs.Longitudinally, necrosis remained constant while oligemia and penumbra decreased, and edema appearing around day 3 which increased with time. GA-UNet shows promise for multi-contrast MR image-based segmentation/quantification of TBI in large cohort studies.
