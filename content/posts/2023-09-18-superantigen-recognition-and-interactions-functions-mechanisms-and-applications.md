description: "Superantigens are unconventional antigens in the sense that they
  elicit a response by binding outside the complementary determining regions
  (CDRs) of their target immune receptor macromolecules (antibodies or T-cell
  receptors). At their initial description in 1989, superantigens were
  originally defined as proteins that hyper-stimulate T-cells via the
  crosslinking of T-cell receptors (TCRs) and MHC Class II molecules (1, 2). "

Superantigens are unconventional antigens which recognise immune receptors outside their usual recognition sites e.g. complementary determining regions (CDRs), to elicit a response within the target cell. T-cell superantigens crosslink T-cell receptors and MHC Class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells, leading to lymphocyte recruitment, induction of cytokine storms and T-cell anergy or apoptosis among many other effects. B-cell superantigens, on the other hand, bind immunoglobulins on B-cells, affecting opsonisation, IgG-mediated phagocytosis, and driving apoptosis. Here, through a review of the structural basis for recognition of immune receptors by superantigens, we show that their binding interfaces share specific physicochemical characteristics when compared with other protein-protein interaction complexes. Given that antibody-binding superantigens have been exploited extensively in industrial antibody purification, these observations could facilitate further protein engineering to optimize the use of superantigens in this and other areas of biotechnology.
