description: Focal adhesions (FAs) play an important role in sensing mechanical
  cues in the extracellular matrix and transducing forces from the extracellular
  matrix into biological signals (Riveline et al., 2001). The cells can sense
  and respond to changes in the rigidity of the underlying substrates. When
  cells are grown on substrates of varying rigidity, they exert larger traction
  stress and migrate towards more rigid substrates in a phenomenon known as
  durotaxis (Lo et al., 2000). In order to sense substrate rigidity, the cells
  apply traction stress through FAs and actin stress fibres to measure
  mechanical responses of the substrate (Discher et al., 2005; Kobayashi and
  Sokabe, 2010; Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2011). While the FA structure of mouse
  fibroblasts has been elucidated at the nanoscale level (Kanchanawong et al.,
  2010), little is known about the substrate rigidity sensing mechanisms of the
  cell.

Key proteins present in the FA in mouse fibroblasts include integrin, paxillin, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), talin, vinculin and zyxin ([Kanchanawong et al., 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B13)). Some proteins in the FA including zyxin have been implicated to function as mechanotransducers, which transmit mechanical signals from the extracellular environment to the cytoskeleton of the cell ([Wang et al., 1993](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B30)). Zyxin was first discovered as a component of cell-substrate adhesions that also localized to the termini of actin stress fibres ([Beckerle, 1986](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B1)). It acts as a mechanotransducer to sense and relay mechanical signals to the cell ([Hirata et al., 2008a](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B10)). Zyxin also facilitates reinforcement of the actin cytoskeleton in response to mechanical forces ([Yoshigi et al., 2005](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B38); [Hirata et al., 2008b](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B9)) and aids cell migration ([Drees et al., 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B6)). It has also been reported that zyxin shuttles between the FAs and nucleus depending on mechanical stimuli in the extracellular environment of the cell ([Beckerle, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B2); [Nix and Beckerle, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B20); [Yoshigi et al., 2005](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B38)). Knocking down zyxin results in defects in actin cytoskeleton remodelling and reinforcement, reduces stress fibre and FA formation, as well as cancer cell migration and invasion ([Harborth et al., 2001](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B8); [Hoffman et al., 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B11); [Yamamura et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.735298/full#B33)). While these studies clearly show that zyxin is involved in cellâ€™s mechanotransduction pathway, the role of zyxin in substrate rigidity sensing still remains unknown. Since rigidity sensing is a key mechanism observed in various cell contexts including durotaxis, we aim to elucidate the role of zyxin, specifically in rigidity sensing which leads to directed cell migration through durotaxis.
