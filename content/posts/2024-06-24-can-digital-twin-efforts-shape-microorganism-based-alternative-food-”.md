With the continuous increment in global population growth, compounded by post-pandemic food security challenges due to labor shortages, effects of climate change, political conflicts, limited land for agriculture, and carbon emissions control, addressing food production in a sustainable manner for future generations is critical. Microorganisms are potential alternative food sources that can help close the gap in food production. For the development of more efficient and yield-enhancing products, it is necessary to have a better understanding on the underlying regulatory molecular pathways of microbial growth. Nevertheless, as microbes are regulated at multiomics scales, current research focusing on single omics (genomics, proteomics, or metabolomics) independently is inadequate for optimizing growth and product output. Here, we discuss digital twin (DT) approaches that integrate systems biology and artificial intelligence in analyzing multiomics datasets to yield a microbial replica model for in silico testing before production. DT models can thus provide a holistic understanding of microbial growth, metabolite biosynthesis mechanisms, as well as identifying crucial production bottlenecks. Our argument, therefore, is to support the development of novel DT models that can potentially revolutionize microorganism-based alternative food production efficiency.
