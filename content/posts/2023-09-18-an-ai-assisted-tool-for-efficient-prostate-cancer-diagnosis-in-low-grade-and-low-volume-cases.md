description: "Pathologists diagnose prostate cancer by core needle biopsy. In
  low-grade and low-volume cases, they look for a few malignant glands out of
  hundreds within a core. They may miss a few malignant glands, resulting in
  repeat biopsies or missed therapeutic opportunities. This study developed a
  multi-resolution deep-learning pipeline to assist pathologists in detecting
  malignant glands in core needle biopsies of low-grade and low-volume cases.
  Analyzing a gland at multiple resolutions, our model exploited morphology and
  neighborhood information, which were crucial in prostate gland classification.
  We developed and tested our pipeline on the slides of a local cohort of 99
  patients in Singapore. Besides, we made the images publicly available,
  becoming the first digital histopathology dataset of patients of Asian
  ancestry with prostatic carcinoma. Our multi-resolution classification model
  achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
  value of 0.992 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.985–0.997) in the external
  validation study, showing the generalizability of our multi-resolution
  approach."

Deep-learning-based assistive tools are becoming an integral part of pathology clinics. They promise to reduce pathologists’ workloads and improve patients’ outcomes. This study focuses on a challenging task rather than an easy one to enhance these promises. It develops a deep-learning-based pipeline detecting low-grade and low-volume prostate cancer that can be easily overlooked, potentially resulting in missed therapeutic opportunities. The pipeline detects the few low-grade cancerous components within a low volume of prostate tissue and highlights high-risk regions for detailed analysis by pathologists. It can help early diagnosis of prostate cancer and effective use of other therapeutic tools at early stages, like active surveillance, rather than aggressive treatments eligible at later stages. Besides, this study conducts an external validation on data of patients from different ancestries, which can be a critical factor in the success of deep-learning-based assistive tools.
