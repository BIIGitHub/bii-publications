description: "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have helped identify
  associations between thousands of genetic variants with various diseases and
  traits (1). The molecular aetiologies of these phenotypes are further enhanced
  with molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL), linking molecular traits with
  phenotypes sharing genetic associations. In particular, genetic associations
  with gene expression and DNA methylation provide useful insight in
  understanding the linkage of susceptibility variants and their related genes
  and cell-specific regulatory elements (2). "

Asians are underrepresented across many omics databases, thereby limiting the potential of precision medicine in nearly 60% of the global population. As such, there is a pressing need for multi-omics derived quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to fill the knowledge gap of complex traits in populations of Asian ancestry. Here, we provide the first blood-based multi-omics analysis of Asian pregnant women, constituting high-resolution genotyping (*N* = 1079), DNA methylation (*N* = 915) and transcriptome profiling (*N* = 238). Integrative omics analysis identified 219 154 CpGs associated with *cis-*DNA methylation QTLs (meQTLs) and 3703 RNAs associated with *cis-*RNA expression QTLs (eQTLs). Ethnicity was the largest contributor of inter-individual variation across all omics datasets, with 2561 genes identified as hotspots of this variation; 395 of these hotspot genes also contained both ethnicity-specific eQTLs and meQTLs. Gene set enrichment analysis of these ethnicity QTL hotspots showed pathways involved in lipid metabolism, adaptive immune system and carbohydrate metabolism. Pathway validation by profiling the lipidome (~480 lipids) of antenatal plasma (*N* = 752) and placenta (*N* = 1042) in the same cohort showed significant lipid differences among Chinese, Malay and Indian women, validating ethnicity-QTL gene effects across different tissue types. To develop deeper insights into the complex traits and benefit future precision medicine research in Asian pregnant women, we developed iMOMdb, an open-access database.
