description: We demonstrated that the selection of protein extraction buffer and
  the processing method could influence protein yield and cross-reactive
  allergen detection from processed and un-processed black soldier fly (BSF)
  samples. In total, 33 putative allergens were detected by comparing the
  detected BSF proteins to sequences from public allergen protein databases. An
  LC-MRM-MS assay was developed for tropomyosin, indicating the importance of
  buffer selection and processing conditions to reduce BSF samples'
  allergenicity.

Exploration of important insect proteins — including allergens — and [proteomes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/proteome "Learn more about proteomes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") can be limited by protein extraction buffer selection and the complexity of the proteome. Herein, LC-MS/MS-based [proteomics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/proteomics "Learn more about proteomics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") experiments were used to assess the protein extraction efficiencies for a suite of extraction buffers and the effect of ingredient processing on proteome and allergen detection. Discovery proteomics revealed that SDS-based buffer yields the maximum number of protein groups from three types of BSF samples. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that buffer [composition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/phase-composition "Learn more about composition from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and ingredient processing could influence allergen detection. Upon applying multi-level filtering criteria, 33 putative allergens were detected by comparing the detected BSF proteins to sequences from public allergen [protein databases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/protein-database "Learn more about protein databases from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). A targeted LC-MRM-MS assay was developed for the pan-allergen [tropomyosin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/tropomyosin "Learn more about tropomyosin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and used to assess the influence of buffer composition and ingredient processing using peptide abundance measurements.
