The ongoing development of drug resistance in HIV continues to push for the need of alternative drug targets in inhibiting HIV. One such target is the Reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme which is unique and critical in the viral life cycle—a rational target that is likely to have less off-target effects in humans. Serendipitously, we found two chemical scaffolds from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Diversity Set V that inhibited HIV-1 RT catalytic activity. Computational structural analyses and subsequent experimental testing demonstrated that one of the two chemical scaffolds binds to a novel location in the HIV-1 RT p51 subunit, interacting with residue Y183, which has no known association with previously reported drug resistance. This finding supports the possibility of a novel druggable site on p51 for a new class of non-nucleoside RT inhibitors that may inhibit HIV-1 RT allosterically. Although inhibitory activity was shown experimentally to only be in the micromolar range, the scaffolds serve as a proof-of-concept of targeting the HIV RT p51 subunit, with the possibility of medical chemistry methods being applied to improve inhibitory activity towards more effective drugs
