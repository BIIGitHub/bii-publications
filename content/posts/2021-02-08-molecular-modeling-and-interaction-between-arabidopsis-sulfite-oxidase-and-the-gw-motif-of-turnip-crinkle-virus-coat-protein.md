  interacts with Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (HCRSV) coat protein (CP) and
  triggers sulfur enhanced defense (SED). In this study, we show the interaction
  of Arabidopsis SO (AtSO) and Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) CP in Arabidopsis
  thaliana plants.

Previous study has shown that Hibiscus sulfite oxidase (SO) interacts with *Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus* (HCRSV) coat protein (CP) and triggers sulfur enhanced defense (SED). In this study, we show the interaction of *Arabidopsis* SO (AtSO) and *Turnip crinkle virus* (TCV) CP in *Arabidopsis thaliana* plants*.* We identified the binding sites of TCV CP (W274) and AtSO (D223) using bioinformatics and confirmed it experimentally. Mutation of binding site W274 to A274 in TCV CP resulted in failure of TCV infection. TCV accumulation in SO over-expression (SO_OE) plants was lower than that in wild-type (WT) and SO knock-out (SO_KO) plants at 7 dpi but reached a level similar to that of WT and SO_KO plants at 10 dpi. AtSO competed with Argonaute 1 (AGO1) for TCV CP binding in vitro. AtSO may serve as an anti-viral factor through sequestering TCV CP for binding with AGO1 and confers virus resistance.
