Colistin or polymyxin B is the last resort antibiotic to treat infections of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria by disrupting their outer membranes. The recent emergence of Gram-negative bacteria that demonstrate colistin resistance, particularly plasmid-mediated mobile colistin resistance (*mcr*), poses a big challenge to the treatment of multidrug resistance infections. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the mechanism of colistin resistance in a model lipid A bilayer mimicking the Gram-negative *mcr*-1 bacterial outer membrane. The simulation results reveal that the outer membrane of normal Gram-negative bacteria is stabilized by salt bridges between positively charged divalent ions and negatively charged phosphate groups of the membranes. In the presence of positively charged polymyxin B, these salt bridges are disrupted, and calcium is released into the aqueous phase, resulting in membrane disruption. In contrast, the lipid A in the outer membrane of *mcr*-1 bacteria has a novel modification, this being a covalently attached phosphoethanolamine group. This group enables the formation of a large number of hydrogen bonds between the amine and phosphate groups, resulting in an electrostatic net on the membrane. This extensive noncovalent electrostatic cross-linking between the lipid molecules collectively enhances the membrane stability and results in resistance to the action of cationic peptides such as polymyxin B. The simulation results shed new atomistic insights for understanding the mechanistic basis of colistin resistance and provide clues for the design of new membrane disruptors and permeabilizers to treat *mcr*-1 infections.
