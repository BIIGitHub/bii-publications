**Background** Combination therapy with radioembolization (yttrium-90)-resin microspheres) followed by nivolumab has shown a promising response rate of 30.6% in a Phase II trial (CA209-678) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the response mechanisms and relevant biomarkers remain unknown.

**Methods** By collecting both pretreatment and on-treatment samples, we performed multimodal profiling of tissue and blood samples and investigated molecular changes associated with favorable responses in 33 patients from the trial.

**Results** We found that higher tumor mutation burden, *NCOR1* mutations and higher expression of interferon gamma pathways occurred more frequently in responders. Meanwhile, non-responders tended to be enriched for a novel Asian-specific transcriptomic subtype (Kaya_P2) with a high frequency of chromosome 16 deletions and upregulated cell cycle pathways. Strikingly, unlike other cancer types, we did not observe any association between T-cell populations and treatment response, but tumors from responders had a higher proportion of CXCL9+/CXCR3+ macrophages. Moreover, biomarkers discovered in previous immunotherapy trials were not predictive in the current cohort, suggesting a distinctive molecular landscape associated with differential responses to the combination therapy.

**Conclusions** This study unraveled extensive molecular changes underlying distinctive responses to the novel treatment and pinpointed new directions for harnessing combination therapy in patients with advanced HCC.
