  BACKGROUND:

  Phomafungin is a recently reported broad spectrum antifungal compound but its
  biosynthetic pathway is unknown. We combed publicly available Phoma genomes
  but failed to find any putative biosynthetic gene cluster that could account
  for its biosynthesis.

BACKGROUND:\
Phomafungin is a recently reported broad spectrum antifungal compound but its biosynthetic pathway is unknown. We combed publicly available Phoma genomes but failed to find any putative biosynthetic gene cluster that could account for its biosynthesis.

RESULTS:\
Therefore, we sequenced the genome of one of our Phoma strains (F3723) previously identified as having antifungal activity in a high-throughput screen. We found a biosynthetic gene cluster that was predicted to synthesize a cyclic lipodepsipeptide that differs in the amino acid composition compared to Phomafungin. Antifungal activity guided isolation yielded a new compound, BII-Rafflesfungin, the structure of which was determined.

CONCLUSIONS:\
We describe the NRPS-t1PKS cluster 'BIIRfg' compatible with the synthesis of the cyclic lipodepsipeptide BII-Rafflesfungin \[HMHDA-L-Ala-L-Glu-L-Asn-L-Ser-L-Ser-D-Ser-D-allo-Thr-Gly]. We report new Stachelhaus codes for Ala, Glu, Asn, Ser, Thr, and Gly. We propose a mechanism for BII-Rafflesfungin biosynthesis, which involves the formation of the lipid part by BIIRfg_PKS followed by activation and transfer of the lipid chain by a predicted AMP-ligase on to the first PCP domain of the BIIRfg_NRPS gene.
