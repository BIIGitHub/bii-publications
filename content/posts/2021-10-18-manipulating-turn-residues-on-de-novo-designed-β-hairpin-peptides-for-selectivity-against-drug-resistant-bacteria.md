description: "Synthetic β-hairpin antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer a useful
  source for the development of novel antimicrobial agents. β-hairpin peptides
  generally consist of two side strands bridged by a reverse turn. In
  literature, most studies focused on the modifications of the side strands to
  manipulate the stability and activity of β-hairpin peptides, and much less is
  known about the impact of the turn region. "

Synthetic β-hairpin [antimicrobial peptides](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/antimicrobial-peptides "Learn more about antimicrobial peptides from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (AMPs) offer a useful source for the development of novel antimicrobial agents. β-hairpin peptides generally consist of two side strands bridged by a reverse turn. In literature, most studies focused on the modifications of the side strands to manipulate the stability and activity of β-hairpin peptides, and much less is known about the impact of the turn region. By designing a series of de novo β-hairpin peptides with identical side strands but varied turns, we demonstrated that mutations of only 2 to 4 amino acids at the turn region could impart a wide range of antimicrobial profiles among synthetic β-hairpin AMPs. BTT2–4 and BTT6 displayed selective potency against Gram-negative bacteria, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 4–8 µM. In contrast, BTT1 exhibited broad-spectrum activity, with MICs of 4–8 µM against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Additionally, BTT1 was potent against methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) and colistin-resistant *Enterobacterales*. The antimicrobial potency of BTT1 persisted after 14 days of serial passage. Mechanistic studies revealed that interactions between [lipopolysaccharide](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/lipopolysaccharide "Learn more about lipopolysaccharide from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (LPS) and the peptides were critical to their membranolytic activity against the bacterial [inner membrane](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/inner-membrane "Learn more about inner membrane from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Aside from folding stability, we observed that a degree of conformational flexibility was required for disruptive membrane interactions.
