  Emerging technologies are playing a major role in the generation of new
  approaches to assess the safety of both foods and drugs. However, the
  integration of emerging technologies in the regulatory decision-making process
  requires rigorous assessment and consensus amongst international partners and
  research communities. To that end, the Global Coalition for Regulatory Science
  Research (GCRSR) in partnership with the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency
  (ANVISA) hosted the seventh Global Summit on Regulatory Science (GSRS17) in
  Brasilia, Brazil on September 18-20, 2017 to discuss the role of new
  approaches in regulatory science with a specific emphasis on applications in
  food and medical product safety.

Emerging technologies are playing a major role in the generation of new approaches to assess the safety of both foods and drugs. However, the integration of emerging technologies in the regulatory decision-making process requires rigorous assessment and consensus amongst international partners and research communities. To that end, the Global Coalition for Regulatory Science Research (GCRSR) in partnership with the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) hosted the seventh Global Summit on Regulatory Science (GSRS17) in Brasilia, Brazil on September 18-20, 2017 to discuss the role of new approaches in regulatory science with a specific emphasis on applications in food and medical product safety. The global regulatory landscape concerning the application of new technologies was assessed in several countries worldwide. Challenges and issues were discussed in the context of developing an international consensus for objective criteria in the development, application and review of emerging technologies. The need for advanced approaches to allow for faster, less expensive and more predictive methodologies was elaborated. In addition, the strengths and weaknesses of each new approach was discussed. And finally, the need for standards and reproducible approaches was reviewed to enhance the application of the emerging technologies to improve food and drug safety. The overarching goal of GSRS17 was to provide a venue where regulators and researchers meet to develop collaborations addressing the most pressing scientific challenges and facilitate the adoption of novel technical innovations to advance the field of regulatory science.
