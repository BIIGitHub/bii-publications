*HNF4A* and *HNF1A* encode transcription factors that are important for the development and function of the pancreas and liver. Mutations in both genes have been directly linked to Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. To better define the pleiotropic gene regulatory roles of HNF4A and HNF1A, we generated a comprehensive genome-wide map of their binding targets in pancreatic and hepatic cells using ChIP-Seq. HNF4A was found to bind and regulate known (*ACY3*, *HAAO, HNF1A*, *MAP3K11*) and previously unidentified (*ABCD3*, *CDKN2AIP*, *USH1C*, *VIL1*) loci in a tissue-dependent manner. Functional follow-up highlighted a potential role for *HAAO* and *USH1C* as regulators of beta cell function. Unlike the loss-of-function HNF4A/MODY1 variant I271fs, the T2D-associated HNF4A variant (rs1800961) was found to activate *AKAP1*, *GAD2* and *HOPX* gene expression, potentially due to changes in DNA-binding affinity. We also found HNF1A to bind to and regulate *GPR39* expression in beta cells. Overall, our studies provide a rich resource for uncovering downstream molecular targets of HNF4A and HNF1A that may contribute to beta cell or hepatic cell (dys)function, and set up a framework for gene discovery and functional validation.
