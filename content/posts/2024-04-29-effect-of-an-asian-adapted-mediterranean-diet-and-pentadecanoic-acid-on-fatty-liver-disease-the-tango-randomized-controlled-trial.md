### Background

Weight loss is the most effective [treatment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/therapeutic-procedure "Learn more about treatment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for [nonalcoholic fatty liver disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver "Learn more about nonalcoholic fatty liver disease from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (NAFLD). There is evidence that the Mediterranean diets rich in [unsaturated fatty acids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/unsaturated-fatty-acid "Learn more about unsaturated fatty acids from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and fiber have beneficial effects on weight [homeostasis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/homeostasis "Learn more about homeostasis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and metabolic risk factors in individuals with NAFLD. Studies have also shown that higher circulating concentrations of [pentadecanoic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pentadecanoic-acid "Learn more about pentadecanoic acid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (C15:0) are associated with a lower risk for NAFLD.

### Objectives

To examine the effects of a Mediterranean-like, culturally contextualized Asian diet rich in fiber and [unsaturated fatty acids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/unsaturated-fatty-acid "Learn more about unsaturated fatty acids from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), with or without C15:0 supplementation, in Chinese females with NAFLD.

### Methods

In a double-blinded, parallel-design, [randomized controlled trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/randomized-controlled-trial "Learn more about randomized controlled trial from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), 88 Chinese females with NAFLD were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups for 12 wk: diet with C15:0 supplementation (*n* = 31), diet without C15:0 supplementation (*n* = 28), or control (habitual diet and no C15:0 supplementation, *n* = 29). At baseline and after the intervention, [body fat percentage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/body-fat-percentage "Learn more about body fat percentage from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), intrahepatic lipid content, muscle and [abdominal fat](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/abdominal-fat "Learn more about abdominal fat from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), [liver enzymes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/liver-enzyme "Learn more about liver enzymes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), [cardiometabolic risk](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cardiometabolic-risk "Learn more about cardiometabolic risk from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") factors, and [gut microbiome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gut-microbiome "Learn more about gut microbiome from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") were assessed.

### Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, weight reductions of 4.0 ± 0.5 kg (5.3%), 3.4 ± 0.5 kg (4.5%), and 1.5 ± 0.5 kg (2.1%) were achieved in the diet-with-C15:0, diet without-C15:0, and the control groups, respectively. The proton density fat fraction (PDFF) of the liver decreased by 33%, 30%, and 10%, respectively. Both diet groups achieved significantly greater reductions in [body weight](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/body-weight "Learn more about body weight from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), liver PDFF, [total cholesterol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/cholesterol-blood-level "Learn more about total cholesterol from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), gamma-glutamyl transferase, and [triglyceride](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/triacylglycerol "Learn more about triglyceride from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") concentrations compared with the control group. C15:0 supplementation reduced LDL-cholesterol further, and increased the abundance of *[Bifidobacterium adolescentis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/bifidobacterium-adolescentis "Learn more about Bifidobacterium adolescentis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")*. [Fat mass](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/fat-mass "Learn more about Fat mass from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), visceral [adipose tissue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/adipose-tissue "Learn more about adipose tissue from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (deep and superficial), insulin, [glycated hemoglobin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/glycated-hemoglobin "Learn more about glycated hemoglobin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and [blood pressure decreased](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/depressed-blood-pressure "Learn more about blood pressure decreased from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") significantly in all groups, in parallel with weight loss.

### Conclusion

Mild weight loss induced by a Mediterranean-like diet adapted for Asians has multiple beneficial health effects in females with NAFLD. C15:0 supplementation lowers LDL-cholesterol and may cause beneficial shifts in the gut microbiome.
