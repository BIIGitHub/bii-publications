Measuring Förster–resonance–energy–transfer (FRET) efficiency allows the investigation of protein–protein interactions (PPI), but extracting quantitative measures of affinity necessitates highly advanced technical equipment or isolated proteins. We demonstrate the validity of a recently suggested novel approach to quantitatively analyze FRET-based experiments in living mammalian cells using standard equipment using the interaction between different type-1 peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1) and their soluble receptor peroxin 5 (PEX5) as a model system. Large data sets were obtained by flow cytometry coupled FRET measurements of cells expressing PTS1-tagged EGFP together with mCherry fused to the PTS1-binding domain of PEX5, and were subjected to a fitting algorithm extracting a quantitative measure of the interaction strength. This measure correlates with results obtained by in vitro techniques and a two-hybrid assay, but is unaffected by the distance between the fluorophores. Moreover, we introduce a live cell competition assay based on this approach, capable of depicting dose- and affinity-dependent modulation of the PPI. Using this system, we demonstrate the relevance of a sequence element next to the core tripeptide in PTS1 motifs for the interaction strength between PTS1 and PEX5, which is supported by a structure-based computational prediction of the binding energy indicating a direct involvement of this sequence in the interaction
