For many years, there has been general interest in developing virtual cells or digital twin models [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/7/1080#B1-biomolecules-13-01080),[2](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/7/1080#B2-biomolecules-13-01080)]. This is due to (i) a purely curiosity-driven need to build theories of life and, (ii) the potential to quickly and safely find cures for diseases by testing drugs in silico before testing them on actual organisms. In any case, systems biology, which combines the strengths of physics, chemistry, computer science, mathematics and engineering concepts with the analysis of biological data or phenomena, has been employed in this field. The constraints imposed by the need to use a physically plausible model is a strong barrier against the overfitting and irrelevance of purely computational approaches [[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/7/1080#B3-biomolecules-13-01080)]. This is especially important since large temporal and spatial data that are crucial for complex models are generated on a regular basis [[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/7/1080#B4-biomolecules-13-01080)]. Thus, in this Special Issue, we intend to showcase some of the latest innovative research and views adopting integrative approaches in biology and diseases with an interdisciplinary perspective.

The first paper by Fedeli and colleagues [[5](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/7/1080#B5-biomolecules-13-01080)] discusses on the theoretical framework that is necessary to understand complex cancers. They review the most popular cancer theory to date, also known as the Somatic Mutation Theory of Carcinogenesis [[6](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/7/1080#B6-biomolecules-13-01080)], and highlight the controversy of considering only the power of gene mutation as the casual factor for cancersâ€™ origin or onset. They reviewed many works containing recent evidence that cancer can be generated or normal cells can become transformed into cancer cells via a myriad mechanisms at the different omics and network levels [[7](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/7/1080#B7-biomolecules-13-01080)]. For example, the cancer microenvironment, which constitutes innate and adaptive immune cells, can induce cell proliferation in neighbouring cells [[8](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/7/1080#B8-biomolecules-13-01080),[9](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/7/1080#B9-biomolecules-13-01080)]. Thus, the authors recommend a novel approach to developing a theory that expands on mutation to include cell-to-cell interactions and data from multiple omics studies. This, in their opinion, will solve the current paradoxes observed in cancer biology.

Another paper by Bizzari and co-workers [[10](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/7/1080#B10-biomolecules-13-01080)] deals with the weaknesses of the Somatic Mutation Theory and remarks that the malignant-to-benign cancer cell transition does not require gene mutation. State transitions can be caused by epigenetic gene expression changes at a network level, without genetic mutation, and many of these state transitions in biology are reversible, e.g., the aerobic to anaerobic states observed in microbes [[11](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/7/1080#B11-biomolecules-13-01080)]. Here, the authors recommend that models of cancer should take reversibility and non-linearity or bifurcation effects into account. Knowing about and theoretically modelling these effects first will surely allow scientists to phenotypically reprogramme them using novel drugs for safe cancer apoptosis.
