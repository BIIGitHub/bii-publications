description: Aberrant wound healing, which leads to irreversible fibrosis,
  underpins many pathological diseases. In the eye, this manifests as
  proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), a major cause of poor vision due to
  failed retinal detachment (RD) surgery1,2. PVR occurs due to proliferative and
  contractile fibrocellular scar membranes that form either in the vitreous or
  surrounding the retina.

One common cause of vision loss after retinal detachment surgery is the formation of proliferative and contractile fibrocellular membranes. This aberrant wound healing process is mediated by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and hyper-proliferation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Current treatment relies primarily on surgical removal of these membranes. Here, we demonstrate that a bio-functional polymer by itself is able to prevent retinal scarring in an experimental rabbit model of proliferative vitreoretinopathy. This is mediated primarily via clathrin-dependent internalisation of polymeric micelles, downstream suppression of canonical EMT transcription factors, reduction of RPE cell hyper-proliferation and migration. Nuclear factor erythroid 2â€“related factor 2 signalling pathway was identified in a genome-wide transcriptomic profiling as a key sensor and effector. This study highlights the potential of using synthetic bio-functional polymer to modulate RPE cellular behaviour and offers a potential therapy for retinal scarring prevention.
