description: Solute carrier transporters are the second largest family of
  membrane proteins responsible for the transport of various substances such as
  saccharides, lipids, amino acids, and inorganic ions across cellular membranes
  (Zhang et al., 2019). One third of all solute carriers such as SLC2, SLC22,
  and SLC45 subfamily belong to the major facilitator superfamily clan (Chen et
  al., 2014; Perland et al., 2017).

Sequence variation in *SLC45A2* are responsible for [oculocutaneous albinism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/oculocutaneous-albinism "Learn more about oculocutaneous albinism from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") type 4 in many species and are associated with [melanoma](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/nodular-melanoma "Learn more about melanoma from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") susceptibility, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. In this study, we used *Slc45a2-*deficient [melanocyte](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/melanocyte "Learn more about melanocyte from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and mouse models to elucidate the roles of SLC45A2 in [melanogenesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/melanogenesis "Learn more about melanogenesis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and [melanoma metastasis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/metastatic-melanoma "Learn more about melanoma metastasis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). We found that the acidified cellular environment impairs the activity of key melanogenic enzyme [tyrosinase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/tyrosinase "Learn more about tyrosinase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in *Slc45a2*-deficient melanocytes. SLC45A2 is identified as a proton/glucose exporter in [melanosomes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/melanosome "Learn more about melanosomes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and its ablation increases the acidification of melanosomal pH through enhanced glycolysis. Intriguingly, 13C-glucose-labeled metabolic flux and biochemical assays show that melanosomes are active glucose-metabolizing organelles, indicating that elevated glycolysis mainly occurs in melanosomes owing to *Slc45a2* deficiency. Moreover, *Slc45a2* deficiency significantly upregulates the activities of [glycolytic enzymes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/glycolytic-enzyme "Learn more about glycolytic enzymes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling to promote glycolysis-dependent survival and [metastasis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/metastatic-carcinoma "Learn more about metastasis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of [melanoma cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/melanoma-cell "Learn more about melanoma cells from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Collectively, our study reveals that the proton/glucose exporter SLC45A2 mediates melanin synthesis and melanoma metastasis primarily by modulating melanosomal [glucose metabolism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/glucose-metabolism "Learn more about glucose metabolism from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").
