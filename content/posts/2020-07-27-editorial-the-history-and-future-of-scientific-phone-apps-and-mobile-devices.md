Mobile apps and devices continue to impact our daily lives. In cities all over the world, smartphones have enabled disruptions (including the Internet of Things or IOT) into daily life for good or bad from transport/daily health tracking to indirectly causing accidents from the lack of situational awareness. Since the launch of this journal in Dec 2015, the smartphone revolution, including the associated IOT, has gained greater ground into scientific research and education than the apps mentioned in the reviews for biomedical research (Gan and Poon 2016) and clinical use (Gan et al. 2016) in the middle of year 2016. There is more scientific and clinical equipment that leverage on the smartphone entering the market and this number is likely to increase further. And this trend will fuel and enable the growth of citizen science in the various disciplines.
