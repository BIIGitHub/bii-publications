description: "Gerontology research on anti-aging interventions with drugs could
  be an answer to age-related diseases, aiming at closing the gap between
  lifespan and healthspan. Here, we present two methods for assaying
  chronological lifespan in human cells: (1) a version of the classical
  outgrowth assay with quantitative assessment of surviving cells and (2) a
  version of the PICLS method (propidium iodide fluorescent-based measurement of
  cell death)."

Gerontology research on anti-aging interventions with drugs could be an answer to age-related diseases, aiming at closing the gap between lifespan and healthspan. Here, we present two methods for assaying chronological lifespan in human cells: (1) a version of the classical outgrowth assay with quantitative assessment of surviving cells and (2) a version of the PICLS method (propidium iodide fluorescent-based measurement of cell death). Both methods are fast, simple to conduct, cost-effective, produce quantitative data for further analysis and can be used with diverse human cell lines. Whereas the first method is ideal for validation and testing the post-intervention reproductive potential of surviving cells, the second method has true high-throughput screening potential. The new technologies were validated with known anti-aging compounds (2,5-anhydro-d-mannitol and rapamycin). Using the high-throughput screening method, we screened a library of 162 chemical entities and identified three compounds that extend the longevity of human cells.
