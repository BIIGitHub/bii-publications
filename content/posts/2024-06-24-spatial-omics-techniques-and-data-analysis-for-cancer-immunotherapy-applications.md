In-depth profiling of cancer cells/tissues is expanding our understanding of the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic landscape of cancer. However, the complexity of the cancer microenvironment, particularly its immune regulation, has made it difficult to exploit the potential of cancer immunotherapy. High-throughput spatial omics technologies and analysis pipelines have emerged as powerful tools for tackling this challenge. As a result, a potential revolution in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment is on the horizon. In this review, we discuss the technological advances in spatial profiling of cancer around and beyond the central dogma to harness the full benefits of immunotherapy. We also discuss the promise and challenges of spatial data analysis and interpretation and provide an outlook for the future.
