The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a rapid response in vaccine and drug development. Herein, we modeled a complete membrane-embedded SARS-CoV-2 spike [glycoprotein](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/glycoprotein "Learn more about glycoprotein from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and used molecular dynamics simulations with benzene probes designed to enhance discovery of cryptic pockets. This approach recapitulated [lipid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/lipid "Learn more about lipid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and host metabolite binding sites previously characterized by cryo-electron microscopy, revealing likely ligand entry routes, and uncovered a novel cryptic pocket with promising druggable properties located underneath the 617–628 loop. A full representation of [glycan](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/polysaccharides "Learn more about glycan from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") moieties was essential to accurately describe pocket dynamics. A multi-conformational behavior of the 617–628 loop in simulations was validated using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experiments, supportive of opening and closing dynamics. The pocket is the site of multiple mutations associated with increased transmissibility found in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern including Omicron. Collectively, this work highlights the utility of the benzene mapping approach in uncovering potential druggable sites on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 targets.
