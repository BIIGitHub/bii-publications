Cancer is widely considered a genetic disease. Notably, recent works have highlighted that every human gene may possibly be associated with cancer. Thus, the distinction between genes that drive oncogenesis and those that are associated to the disease, but do not play a role, requires attention. Here we investigated single cells and bulk (cell-population) datasets of several cancer transcriptomes and proteomes in relation to their healthy counterparts. When analyzed by machine learning and statistical approaches in bulk datasets, both general and cancer-specific oncogenes, as defined by the Cancer Genes Census, show invariant behavior to randomly selected gene sets of the same size for all cancers. However, when proteinâ€“protein interaction analyses were performed, the oncogenes-derived networks show higher connectivity than those relative to random genes. Moreover, at single-cell scale, we observe variant behavior in a subset of oncogenes for each considered cancer type. Moving forward, we concur that the role of oncogenes needs to be further scrutinized by adopting protein causality and higher-resolution single-cell analyses.
