description: Of more than 300 million surgical procedures performed worldwide
  annually,[1] almost 10% develop surgical site infections (SSIs).[2] SSIs
  account for a substantial clinical and economic burden.[3] Although many
  factors contribute to SSIs, preventive measures before, during, and after
  surgery can lower the SSI incidence.[4] Causes of SSIs vary depending on
  anatomy, surgical procedure, and exogenous in addition to endogenous,
  patient-derived factors. Bacterial contamination is one cause that can be
  controlled.[4, 5] In hospitals, preventive measures such as hygiene routines
  are implemented but even under sterile surgical conditions, infections may
  occur due to the spread of bacteria from the patient's own bacterial flora.[6]
  It has also been reported that up to 60% of the bacteria recovered from
  infected surgical wounds developed antibiotic resistance.[7]

Surgical site infections (SSI) are a clinical and economic burden. Suture-associated SSI may develop when bacteria colonize the suture surface and form biofilms that are resistant to antibiotics. Thrombin-derived C-terminal peptide (TCP)-25 is a host defense peptide with a unique dual mode of action that can target both bacteria and the excessive inflammation induced by bacterial products. The peptide demonstrates therapeutic potential in preclinical in vivo wound infection models. In this study, the authors set out to explore whether TCP-25 can provide a new bioactive innate immune feature to hydrophilic polyglactin sutures (Vicryl). Using a combination of biochemical, biophysical, antibacterial, biofilm, and anti-inflammatory assays in vitro, in silico molecular modeling studies, along with experimental infection and inflammation models in mice, a proof-of-concept that TCP-25 can provide Vicryl sutures with a previously undisclosed host defense capacity, that enables targeting of bacteria, biofilms, and the accompanying inflammatory response, is shown.
