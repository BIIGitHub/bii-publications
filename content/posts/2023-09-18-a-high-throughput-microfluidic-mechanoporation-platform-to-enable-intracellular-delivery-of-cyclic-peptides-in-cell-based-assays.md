Cyclic peptides are poised to target historically difficult to drug intracellular protein–protein interactions, however, their general cell impermeability poses a challenge for characterizing function. Recent advances in microfluidics have enabled permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane by physical cell deformation (i.e., mechanoporation), resulting in intracellular delivery of impermeable macromolecules in vector- and electrophoretic-free approaches. However, the number of payloads (e.g., peptides) and/or concentrations delivered via microfluidic mechanoporation is limited by having to pre-mix cells and payloads, a manually intensive process. In this work, we show that cells are momentarily permeable (*t*1/2 = 1.1–2.8 min) after microfluidic vortex shedding (μVS) and that lower molecular weight macromolecules can be cytosolically delivered upon immediate exposure after cells are processed/permeabilized. To increase the ability to screen peptides, we built a system, dispensing-microfluidic vortex shedding (DμVS), that integrates a μVS chip with inline microplate-based dispensing. To do so, we synced an electronic pressure regulator, flow sensor, on/off dispense valve, and an x-y motion platform in a software-driven feedback loop. Using this system, we were able to deliver low microliter-scale volumes of transiently mechanoporated cells to hundreds of wells on microtiter plates in just several minutes (e.g., 96-well plate filled in <2.5 min). We validated the delivery of an impermeable peptide directed at MDM2, a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53, using a click chemistry- and NanoBRET-based cell permeability assay in 96-well format, with robust delivery across the full plate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DμVS could be used to identify functional, low micromolar, cellular activity of otherwise cell-inactive MDM2-binding peptides using a p53 reporter cell assay in 96- and 384-well format. Overall, DμVS can be combined with downstream cell assays to investigate intracellular target engagement in a high-throughput manner, both for improving structure–activity relationship efforts and for early proof-of-biology of non-optimized peptide (or potentially other macromolecular) tools.
