Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading cancers worldwide. Classically, HCC develops in genetically susceptible individuals who are exposed to risk factors, especially in the presence of [liver cirrhosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/liver-cirrhosis "Learn more about liver cirrhosis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Significant temporal and geographic variations exist for HCC and its etiologies. Over time, the burden of HCC has shifted from the lowâ€“moderate to the high sociodemographic index regions, reflecting the transition from viral to nonviral causes. Geographically, the [hepatitis viruses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hepatitis-virus "Learn more about hepatitis viruses from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") predominate as the causes of HCC in Asia and Africa. Although there are genetic conditions that confer increased risk for HCC, these diagnoses are rarely recognized outside North America and Europe. In this review, we will evaluate the epidemiologic trends and risk factors of HCC, and discuss the genetics of HCC, including monogenic [diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/disease "Learn more about diseases from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), single-nucleotide polymorphisms, [gut microbiome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gut-microbiome "Learn more about gut microbiome from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and [somatic mutations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/somatic-mutation "Learn more about somatic mutations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").
