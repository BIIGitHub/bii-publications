description: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
  investigate newborn TL variation in umbilical cord tissue and report a
  comprehensive analysis of the effects of heritable factors, socioeconomic
  status, antenatal maternal health, and nutrition on this variation. It is
  known that TL is maximal at birth and decreases progressively with advancing
  age, and thus is considered a marker of biological aging [26]. In our study,
  we found relative average TL of newborns to be longer than the length of TL
  observed in their mothers (average maternal age, 31 years old). Maternal TL
  negatively correlated with maternal age ranging from 18 to 46 years. Newborn
  TL was not associated with gestational age but showed positive association
  with parental age. Comparison of the paternal and maternal age effects in the
  same regression model showed paternal age to have a dominant effect. This
  finding suggests that offsprings of older mothers could have longer TL in the
  analysis simply because the offsprings’ fathers were also older. Supporting
  this hypothesis, we indeed found a strong correlation between the parents’ age
  in our cohort. Previous studies [37,38,39] have reported increase in sperm TL
  with age as a potential reason for offsprings of older fathers to inherit
  longer telomeres. As oocytes are produced prenatally, while sperm are
  continually produced throughout life, it is believed that there is greater
  potential for TL plasticity with age in sperms than in oocytes. Effect of
  paternal age on newborn TL is intriguing as it potentiates a scenario of
  intergenerational genetic plasticity in which the DNA passed on to the
  offspring is systematically changed based upon the reproductive age of one’s
  father.

### Background

Telomere length (TL) and its attrition are important indicators of physiological stress and biological aging and hence may vary among individuals of the same age. This variation is apparent even in newborns, suggesting potential effects of parental factors and the intrauterine environment on TL of the growing fetus.

### Methods

Average relative TLs of newborns (cord tissue, *N* = 950) and mothers (buffy coat collected at 26–28 weeks of gestation, *N* = 892) were measured in a birth cohort. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of heritable factors, socioeconomic status, and in utero exposures linked with maternal nutrition, cardiometabolic health, and mental well-being on the newborn TL. The association between maternal TL and antenatal maternal health was also studied.

### Results

Longer maternal TL (*β* = 0.14, *P* = 1.99E−05) and higher paternal age (*β* = 0.10, *P* = 3.73E−03) were positively associated with newborn TL. Genome-wide association studies on newborn and maternal TLs identified 6 genetic variants in a strong linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 3q26.2 (Tag SNP-*LRRC34*-rs10936600: *P*meta = 5.95E−08). Mothers with higher anxiety scores, elevated fasting blood glucose, lower plasma insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 and vitamin B12 levels, and active smoking status during pregnancy showed a higher risk of giving birth to offspring with shorter TL. There were sex-related differences in the factors explaining newborn TL variation. Variation in female newborn TL was best explained by maternal TL, mental health, and plasma vitamin B12 levels, while that in male newborn TL was best explained by paternal age, maternal education, and metabolic health. Mother’s TL was associated with her own metabolic health and nutrient status, which may have transgenerational effects on offspring TL.

### Conclusions

Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the heritable and environmental factors and their relative contributions to the initial setting of TL and programing of longevity in early life. This study provides valuable insights for preventing in utero telomere attrition by improving the antenatal health of mothers via targeting the modifiable factors.
