description: Mounting evidence have revealed that despite the high degree of
  sequence homology between cytochrome P450 3A isoforms (i.e. CYP3A4 and
  CYP3A5), they have the propensities to exhibit vastly different irreversible
  and reversible interactions with a single substrate. We have previously
  established that benzbromarone (BBR), a potent uricosuric agent utilized in
  the management of gout, irreversibly inhibits CYP3A4 via mechanism-based
  inactivation (MBI).

Mounting evidence have revealed that despite the high degree of sequence homology between cytochrome P450 3A isoforms (i.e. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5), they have the propensities to exhibit vastly different irreversible and reversible interactions with a single substrate. We have previously established that benzbromarone (BBR), a potent uricosuric agent utilized in the management of gout, irreversibly inhibits CYP3A4 via mechanism-based inactivation (MBI). However, it remains unelucidated if CYP3A5 - its highly homologous counterpart - is susceptible to inactivation by BBR. Using three structurally-distinct probe substrates, we consistently demonstrated that MBI was not elicited in CYP3A5 by BBR. Our *in silico* covalent docking models and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that disparities in the susceptibilities towards MBI could be attributed to the specific effects of BBR covalent adducts on the F-F' loop. Serendipitously, we also discovered that BBR reversibly activated CYP3A5-mediated rivaroxaban hydroxylation where apparent *V*max increased and *K*m decreased with increasing BBR concentration. Fitting data to the two-site model yielded interaction factors α and β of 0.44 and 5.88, respectively, thereby confirming heterotropic activation of CYP3A5 by BBR. Furthermore, heteroactivation was suppressed by the CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole in a concentration-dependent manner and decreased with increasing pre-incubation time, implying that activation was incited via binding of parent BBR molecule within the enzymatic active site. Finally, non-covalent docking revealed that CYP3A5 can more favorably accommodate both BBR and rivaroxaban in concert as compared to CYP3A4 which further substantiated our experimental observations.
