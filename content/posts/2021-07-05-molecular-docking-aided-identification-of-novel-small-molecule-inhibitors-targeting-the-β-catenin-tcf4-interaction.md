Here we report a molecular docking-based approach to identify small molecules that can target the β-catenin (β-cat)-TCF4 protein-protein interaction (PPI), a key effector complex for nuclear Wnt signaling activity. Specifically, we developed and optimized a computational model of β-cat using publicly available β-cat protein crystal structures, and existing β-cat-TCF4 interaction inhibitors as the training set. Using our computational model to an *in silico* screen predicted 27 compounds as good binders to β-cat, of which 3 were identified to be effective against a Wnt-responsive luciferase reporter. *In vitro* functional validation experiments revealed GB1874 as an inhibitor of the Wnt pathway that targets the β-cat-TCF4 PPI. GB1874 also affected the proliferation and stemness of Wnt-addicted colorectal cancer (CRC) cells *in vitro*. Encouragingly, GB1874 inhibited the growth of CRC tumor xenografts *in vivo*, thus demonstrating its potential for further development into therapeutics against Wnt-associated cancer indications.
