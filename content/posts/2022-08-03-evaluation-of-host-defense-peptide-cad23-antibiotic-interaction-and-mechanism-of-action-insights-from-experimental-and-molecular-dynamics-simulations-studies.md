description: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is currently one of the major global
  health threats. (Prestinaci et al., 2015; Ventola, 2015) By 2050, it is
  estimated to cause 10 million deaths and cost the global economy up to 100
  trillion USD if the issue remains untackled. (O’Neill, 2016) In addition,
  non-systemic infections, including ocular and skin infections, are being
  increasingly affected by drug-resistant pathogens, which usually result in
  poor prognosis (Ventola, 2015; Pulido-Cejudo et al., 2017; Ting et al.,
  2021a). In view of the colossal impact on global health and economy, various
  initiatives and strategies have been proposed and implemented to tackle AMR.
  These include establishment of antimicrobial stewardship to monitor the use of
  antimicrobial agents and the rise of AMR, development of new drugs and
  vaccines, drug repurposing, and incentivising pharmaceutical companies for
  investing in antimicrobial drug development. (Ventola, 2015)

**Background/Aim:** Host defense peptides (HDPs) have the potential to provide a novel solution to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in view of their unique and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities. We had recently developed a novel hybrid HDP based on LL-37 and human beta-defensin-2, named CaD23, which was shown to exhibit good *in vivo* antimicrobial efficacy against *Staphylococcus aureus* in a bacterial keratitis murine model. This study aimed to examine the potential CaD23-antibiotic synergism and the secondary structure and underlying mechanism of action of CaD23.

**Methods:** Peptide-antibiotic interaction was evaluated against *S. aureus*, methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* (MRSA), and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* using established checkerboard and time-kill assays. Fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated and interpreted as synergistic (FIC<0.5), additive (FIC between 0.5–1.0), indifferent (FIC between >1.0 and ≤4), or antagonistic (FIC>4). SYTOX green uptake assay was performed to determine the membrane-permeabilising action of CaD23. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to evaluate the interaction of CaD23 with bacterial and mammalian mimetic membranes. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was also performed to examine the secondary structures of CaD23.

**Results:** CaD23-amikacin and CaD23-levofloxacin combination treatment exhibited a strong additive effect against *S. aureus* SH1000 (FICI = 0.60–0.69) and MRSA43300 (FICI = 0.56–0.60) but an indifferent effect against *P. aeruginosa* (FIC = 1.03–1.15). CaD23 (at 25 μg/ml; 2xMIC) completely killed *S. aureus* within 30 min. When used at sub-MIC concentration (3.1 μg/ml; 0.25xMIC), it was able to expedite the antimicrobial action of amikacin against *S. aureus* by 50%. The rapid antimicrobial action of CaD23 was attributed to the underlying membrane-permeabilising mechanism of action, evidenced by the SYTOX green uptake assay and MD simulations studies. MD simulations revealed that cationicity, alpha-helicity, amphiphilicity and hydrophobicity (related to the Trp residue at C-terminal) play important roles in the antimicrobial action of CaD23. The secondary structures of CaD23 observed in MD simulations were validated by CD spectroscopy.

**Conclusion:** CaD23 is a novel alpha-helical, membrane-active synthetic HDP that can enhance and expedite the antimicrobial action of antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria when used in combination. MD simulations serves as a powerful tool in revealing the peptide secondary structure, dissecting the mechanism of action, and guiding the design and optimisation of HDPs.
