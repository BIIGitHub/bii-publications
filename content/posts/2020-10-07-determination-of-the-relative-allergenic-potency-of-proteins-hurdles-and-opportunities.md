The use of proteins and protein-containing materials in a variety of industrial and commercial products is increasing, with applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and consumer and personal care products. As a consequence there is a need to ensure potential and environmental risks are understood. One important requirement is an appreciation of the ability of proteins to induce allergic sensitization and allergic disease. However, there is currently no clear guidance for determination of whether or not to accept a new protein in a product based on potential allergenicity. A key requirement for effective risk assessment in this respect is an understanding of sensitizing potency. Here we describe issues and challenges associated with measurement of allergenic potency and explore emerging opportunities and possible ways forward. Effective assessment of the risk of allergy demands not only information about the likely conditions of exposure, but also an understanding of the sensitizing potency of protein allergens. For the purposes of this article sensitizing potency can be viewed as being the ease with which, and the concentration at which, proteins will induce sensitization in a previously non-sensitized subject. The immunological bases of protein allergy are summarized, and the properties that confer on proteins the ability to induce allergic sensitization are considered prior to a detailed exploration of the issues that have to be addressed for evaluation of sensitizing potency. Included among the important considerations are: the impact of route of exposure, identification of relevant dose metrics, and the requirement for reference standards. Finally, new and emerging opportunities to evaluate the sensitizing potency of allergenic proteins are reviewed, including the use of *in silico* modeling.
