Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly lethal disease driven by glioma stem cells (GSCs). Here, we use a chemical biology approach to unveil previously unknown GBM dependencies. By studying sulconazole (SN) with anti-GSC properties, we find that SN disrupts biotin distribution to the carboxylases and histones. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of SN-treated GSCs reveal metabolic alterations that are characteristic of biotin-deficient cells, including intracellular cholesterol depletion, impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, and energetic crisis. Furthermore, SN treatment reduces histone biotinylation, histone acetylation, and expression of superenhancer-associated GSC critical genes, which are also observed when biotin distribution is genetically disrupted by holocarboxylase synthetase (*HLCS*) depletion. *HLCS* silencing impaired GSC tumorigenicity in an orthotopic xenograft brain tumor model. In GBM, high *HLCS* expression robustly indicates a poor prognosis. Thus, the dependency of GBM on biotin distribution suggests that the rational cotargeting of biotin-dependent metabolism and epigenetic pathways may be explored for GSC eradication.
