description: Cell culture is widely used in biotechnology to manufacture various
  useful products for applications such as pharmaceuticals, food, biofuel, and
  industrial products. Cell culture production systems in industry and research
  span different kingdoms of life from free living microbes such as bacteria,
  archaea, and fungi, to cell lines derived from multicellular organisms
  including insect and mammalian species. Products include pharmaceuticals such
  as antibiotics and monoclonal antibodies; food products such as rennet,
  single-cell protein, and cultivated meat; biofuel from lipid-producing algae;
  industrial products such as cleaning enzymes and organic acids.

Cell culture media composition and culture conditions play a crucial role in product yield, quality and cost of production. Culture media optimization is the technique of improving media composition and culture conditions to achieve desired product outcomes. To achieve this, there have been many algorithmic methods proposed and used for culture media optimization in the literature. To help readers evaluate and decide on a method that best suits their specific application, we carried out a systematic review of the different methods from an algorithmic perspective that classifies, explains and compares the available methods. We also examine the trends and new developments in the area. This review provides recommendations to researchers regarding the suitable media optimization algorithm for their applications and we hope to also promote the development of new cell culture media optimization methods that are better suited to existing and upcoming challenges in this biotechnology field, which will be essential for more efficient production of various cell culture products.
