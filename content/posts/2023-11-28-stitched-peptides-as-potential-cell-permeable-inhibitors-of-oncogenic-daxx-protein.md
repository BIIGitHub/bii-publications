description: DAXX (Death Domain Associated Protein 6), initially identified as a
  potentiator of apoptosis, is known to play crucial roles in several vital
  biological pathways, including chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation,
  DNA repair, and innate immunity. Its increased expression has been observed in
  diverse, epidemiologically prevalent cancers

DAXX (Death Domain Associated Protein 6) is frequently upregulated in various common cancers, and its suppression has been linked to reduced tumor progression. Consequently, DAXX has gained significant interest as a therapeutic target in such cancers. DAXX is known to function in several critical biological pathways including chromatin remodelling, transcription regulation, and DNA repair. Leveraging structural information, we have designed and developed a novel set of stapled/stitched peptides that specifically target a surface on the N-terminal helical bundle domain of DAXX. This surface serves as the anchor point for binding to multiple interaction partners, such as Rassf1C, p53, Mdm2, and ATRX, as well as for the auto-regulation of the DAXX N-terminal SUMO interaction motif (SIM). Our experiments demonstrate that these peptides effectively bind to and inhibit DAXX with a higher affinity than the known interaction partners. Furthermore, these peptides release the auto-inhibited SIM, enabling it to interact with SUMOâˆ’1. Importantly, we have developed stitched peptides that can enter cells, maintaining their intracellular concentrations at nanomolar levels even after 24 hours, without causing any membrane perturbation. Collectively, our findings suggest that these stitched peptides not only serve as valuable tools for probing the molecular interactions of DAXX but also hold potential as precursors to the development of therapeutic interventions.
