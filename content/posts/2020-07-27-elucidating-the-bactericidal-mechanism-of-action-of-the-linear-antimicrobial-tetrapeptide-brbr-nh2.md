  Linear antimicrobial peptides, with their rapid bactericidal mode of action,
  are well-suited for development as topical antibacterial drugs. We recently
  designed a synthetic linear 4-residue peptide, BRBR-NH2, with potent
  bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 6.25 μM), the main
  causative pathogen of human skin infections with an unknown mechanism of
  action.

Linear antimicrobial peptides, with their rapid bactericidal mode of action, are well-suited for development as topical antibacterial drugs. We recently designed a synthetic linear 4-residue peptide, BRBR-NH2, with potent bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 6.25 μM), the main causative pathogen of human skin infections with an unknown mechanism of action. Herein, we describe a series of experiments conducted to gain further insights into its mechanism of action involving electron microscopy, artificial membrane dye leakage, solution- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy followed by molecular dynamics simulations. Experimental results point towards a SMART (Soft Membranes Adapt and Respond, also Transiently) mechanism of action, suggesting that the peptide can be developed as a topical antibacterial agent for treating drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
