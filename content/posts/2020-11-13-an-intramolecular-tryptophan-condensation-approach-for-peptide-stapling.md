Stapled peptides are gaining tremendous interest as next-generation therapeutic agents to target protein–protein interactions. Herein, we report an intramolecular peptide stapling method which links two tryptophan residues at the C2 position of the indole moieties *via* acid-mediated condensation with an aldehyde.
