  This article contains further data and information from our published
  manuscript [1]. We aim to identify significant transcriptome alterations of
  vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the aortic wall of myocardial
  infarction (MI) patients. Microarray gene analysis was applied to evaluate
  VSMCs of MI and non-MI patients. Prediction Analysis of Microarray (PAM)
  identified genes that significantly discriminated the two groups of samples.
  Incorporation of gene ontology (GO) identified a VSMCs-associated classifier
  that discriminated between the two groups of samples. Mass spectrometry-based
  iTRAQ analysis revealed proteins significantly differentiating these two
  groups of samples. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed top pathways
  associated with hypoxia signaling in cardiovascular system. Enrichment
  analysis of these proteins suggested an activated pathway, and an integrated
  transcriptome-proteome pathway analysis revealed that it is the most
  implicated pathway. The intersection of the top candidate molecules from the
  transcriptome and proteome highlighted overexpression.
