ezSingleCell is an interactive and easy-to-use application for analysing various single-cell and spatial omics data types without requiring prior programing knowledge. It combines the best-performing publicly available methods for in-depth data analysis, integration, and interactive data visualization. ezSingleCell consists of five modules, each designed to be a comprehensive workflow for one data type or task. In addition, ezSingleCell allows crosstalk between different modules within a unified interface. Acceptable input data can be in a variety of formats while the output consists of publication ready figures and tables. In-depth manuals and video tutorials are available to guide users on the analysis workflows and parameter adjustments to suit their study aims. ezSingleCellâ€™s streamlined interface can analyse a standard scRNA-seq dataset of 3000 cells in less than five minutes. ezSingleCell is available in two forms: an installation-free web application (<https://immunesinglecell.org/ezsc/>) or a software package with a shinyApp interface (<https://github.com/JinmiaoChenLab/ezSingleCell2>) for offline analysis.
