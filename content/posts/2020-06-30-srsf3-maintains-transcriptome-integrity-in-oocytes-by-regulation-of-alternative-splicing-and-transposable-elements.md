  The RNA-binding protein SRSF3 (also known as SRp20) has critical roles in the
  regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Zygotic knockout of Srsf3 results in embryo
  arrest at the blastocyst stage. However, SRSF3 is also present in oocytes,
  suggesting that it might be critical as a maternally inherited factor. Here we
  identify SRSF3 as an essential regulator of alternative splicing and of
  transposable elements to maintain transcriptome integrity in mouse oocyte.

The RNA-binding protein SRSF3 (also known as SRp20) has critical roles in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Zygotic knockout of*Srsf3*results in embryo arrest at the blastocyst stage. However, SRSF3 is also present in oocytes, suggesting that it might be critical as a maternally inherited factor. Here we identify SRSF3 as an essential regulator of alternative splicing and of transposable elements to maintain transcriptome integrity in mouse oocyte. Using 3D time-lapse confocal live imaging, we show that conditional deletion of*Srsf3*in fully grown germinal vesicle oocytes substantially compromises the capacity of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), and consequently entry into meiosis. By combining single cell RNA-seq, and oocyte micromanipulation with steric blocking antisense oligonucleotides and RNAse-H inducing gapmers, we found that the GVBD defect in mutant oocytes is due to both aberrant alternative splicing and derepression of B2 SINE transposable elements. Together, our study highlights how control of transcriptional identity of the maternal transcriptome by the RNA-binding protein SRSF3 is essential to the development of fertilized-competent oocytes.
