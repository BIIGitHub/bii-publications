We tackle here genomic mechanisms of a rapid onset and recovery from anosmiaâ€”a potential diagnostic indicator for early-stage COVID-19 infection. Based on previous observations on how olfactory receptor (OR) gene expression is regulated via chromatin structure in mice, we hypothesized that the disruption of the OR gene expression and, respectively, deficiency of the OR function can be caused by chromatin reorganization taking place upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We obtained chromatin ensemble reconstructions from COVID-19 patients and control samples using our original computational framework for the whole-genome 3D chromatin ensemble reconstruction. Specifically, we used megabase-scale structural units and effective interactions between them obtained in the Markov State modelling of the Hi-C contact network as an unput in the stochastic embedding procedure of the whole-genome 3D chromatin ensemble reconstruction. We have also developed here a new procedure for analyzing fine structural hierarchy with (sub)TAD-size units in local chromatin regions, which we apply here to parts of chromosomes containing OR genes and corresponding regulatory elements. We observed structural modifications in COVID-19 patients on different levels of chromatin organization, from the alteration of whole genome structure and chromosomal intermingling to reorganization of contacts between chromatin loops at the level of topologically associating domains. While complementary data on known regulatory elements point to potential pathology-associated changes within the overall picture of chromatin alterations, further investigation using additional epigenetic factors mapped on 3D reconstructions with improved resolution will be required for better understanding of anosmia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
