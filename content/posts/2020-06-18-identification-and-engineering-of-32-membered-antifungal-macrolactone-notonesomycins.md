  Notonesomycin A is a 32-membered bioactive glycosylated macrolactone known to
  be produced by Streptomyces aminophilus subsp. notonesogenes 647-AV1 and S.
  aminophilus DSM 40186. In a high throughput antifungal screening campaign, we
  identified an alternative notonesomycin A producing strain, Streptomyces sp.
  A793, and its biosynthetic gene cluster.

Notonesomycin A is a 32-membered bioactive glycosylated macrolactone known to be produced by Streptomyces aminophilus subsp. notonesogenes 647-AV1 and S. aminophilus DSM 40186. In a high throughput antifungal screening campaign, we identified an alternative notonesomycin A producing strain, Streptomyces sp. A793, and its biosynthetic gene cluster. From this strain, we further characterized a new more potent antifungal non-sulfated analogue, named notonesomycin B. Through CRISPRâ€“Cas9 engineering of the biosynthetic gene cluster, we were able to increase the production yield of notonesomycin B by up to 18-fold as well as generate a strain that exclusively produces this analogue.
