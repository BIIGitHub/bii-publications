description: Mouse monoclonal antibody M4M was recently designed to block human
  TRPM4 channel. The polypeptide for generating M4M is composed of peptide A1
  between the transmembrane segment 5 (S5) and the pore, and a second peptide A2
  between the pore and the transmembrane segment 6 (S6).

Mouse monoclonal antibody M4M was recently designed to block human TRPM4 channel. The polypeptide for generating M4M is composed of peptide A1 between the transmembrane segment 5 (S5) and the pore, and a second peptide A2 between the pore and the transmembrane segment 6 (S6). Using peptide microarray, a 4-amino acid sequence EPGF within the A2 was identified to be the binding epitope for M4M. Substitution of EPGF with other amino acids greatly reduced binding affinity. Structural analysis of human TRPM4 structure indicates that EPGF is located externally to the channel pore. A1 is close to the EPGF binding epitope in space, albeit separated by a 37-amino acid peptide. Electrophysiological study reveals that M4M could block human TRPM4, but with no effect on rodent TRPM4 which shares a different amino acid sequence ERGS for the binding motif. Our results demonstrate that M4M is a specific inhibitor for human TRPM4.
