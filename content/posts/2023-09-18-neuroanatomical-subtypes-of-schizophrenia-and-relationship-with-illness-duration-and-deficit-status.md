description: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic and serious mental illness
  affecting >27 million worldwide (GBD 2017 Disease and Injury Incidence and
  Prevalence Collaborators, 2018). Heterogeneity in neurobiology (Voineskos et
  al., 2020), polygenic scores (Alnæs et al., 2019), symptom presentations (Van
  Rheenen et al., 2017), treatment responses (Malhotra, 2015), and outcomes
  (Huber, 1997) and their inter-relationships remain incompletely understood and
  can potentially confound evaluation and affect management of the condition
  (Lakhan and Vieira, 2009). Grouping patients by clinical subtypes allows for a
  deeper examination of homogenous groups, and this is often done using measures
  which assess symptomatology (e.g positive/negative symptom domains), cognitive
  status or illness course (e.g remission status) (Tan et al., 2020; Weinberg et
  al., 2016; Wong et al., 2020). Previous studies have attempted to link these
  clinical subtypes in SCZ based on deficit syndrome (Tan et al., 2020),
  cognitive functioning (Ho et al., 2020; Seaton et al., 2001; Weinberg et al.,
  2016) and remission status (Wong et al., 2020) with underlying neural
  substrates.

### Background

The heterogeneity of [schizophrenia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/dementia-praecox "Learn more about schizophrenia from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (SCZ) regarding psychopathology, [illness trajectory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/illness-trajectory "Learn more about illness trajectory from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and their inter-relationships with underlying [neural substrates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neural-substrate "Learn more about neural substrates from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") remain incompletely understood. In a bid to reduce illness heterogeneity using [neural substrates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neural-substrate "Learn more about neural substrates from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), our study aimed to replicate the findings of an earlier study by Chand et al. (2020). We employed brain structural measures for subtyping SCZ patients, and evaluate each subtype's relationship with clinical features such as illness duration, psychotic psychopathology, and additionally deficit status.

### Methods

Overall, 240 subjects (160 SCZ patients, 80 healthy controls) were recruited for this study. The participants underwent brain [structural magnetic resonance imaging](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/structural-magnetic-resonance-imaging "Learn more about structural magnetic resonance imaging from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") scans and clinical rating using the [Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/positive-and-negative-syndrome-scale "Learn more about Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Neuroanatomical subtypes of SCZ were identified using “Heterogeneity through discriminative analysis” (HYDRA), a clustering technique which accounted for relevant covariates and the inter-group normalized percentage changes in brain volume were also calculated.

### Results

As replicated, two neuroanatomical subtypes (SG-1 and SG-2) were found amongst our patients with SCZ. The subtype SG-1 was associated with enlargements in the third and [lateral ventricles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/lateral-ventricle "Learn more about lateral ventricles from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), volume increase in the [basal ganglia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/basal-ganglia "Learn more about basal ganglia from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (putamen, caudate, pallidum), longer illness duration, and deficit status. The subtype SG-2 was associated with reductions of cortical and [subcortical structures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/subcortical-structure "Learn more about subcortical structures from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (hippocampus, [thalamus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/thalamus "Learn more about thalamus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), basal ganglia).

### Conclusions

These replicated findings have clinical implications in the early intervention, response monitoring, and prognostication of SCZ. Future studies may adopt a multi-modal neuroimaging approach to enhance insights into the neurobiological composition of relevant subtypes.
