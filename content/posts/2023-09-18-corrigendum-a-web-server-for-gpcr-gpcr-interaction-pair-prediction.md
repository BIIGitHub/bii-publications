description: "G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) form higher-order molecular
  complexes (oligomers) with other GPCRs. The molecular functions of such
  oligomers differ from those of monomers with respect to at least one of the
  following examples: endogenous ligand binding, coupling with trimeric
  G-proteins, expression levels on membrane, and intracellular trafficking. The
  regulatory chemicals of oligomer formation are likely to work by different
  mechanisms from those of the existing GPCR-targeted chemicals (1–6). GPCR-GPCR
  interactions are unique in that GPCRs with different molecular functions
  interact with each other and exert molecular functions that are completely
  different from those of the monomers, as reviewed previously (7–9). GPCR
  hetero-dimers are considered to be novel therapeutic targets (10)."

The GGIP web server (<https://protein.b.dendai.ac.jp/GGIP/>) provides a web application for GPCR-GPCR interaction pair prediction by a support vector machine. The server accepts two sequences in the FASTA format. It responds with a prediction that the input GPCR sequence pair either interacts or not. GPCRs predicted to interact with the monomers constituting the pair are also shown when query sequences are human GPCRs. The server is simple to use. A pair of amino acid sequences in the FASTA format is pasted into the text area, a PDB ID for a template structure is selected, and then the ‘Execute’ button is clicked. The server quickly responds with a prediction result. The major advantage of this server is that it employs the GGIP software, which is presently the only method for predicting GPCR-interaction pairs. Our web server is freely available with no login requirement. In this article, we introduce some application examples of GGIP for disease-associated mutation analysis.
