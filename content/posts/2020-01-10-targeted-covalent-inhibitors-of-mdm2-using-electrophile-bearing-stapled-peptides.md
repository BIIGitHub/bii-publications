  Herein, we describe the development of a novel staple with an electrophilic
  warhead to enable the generation of stapled peptide covalent inhibitors of the
  p53-MDM2 protein-protein interaction (PPI). The peptide developed showed
  complete and selective covalent binding resulting in potent inhibition of
  p53-MDM2 PPI.
