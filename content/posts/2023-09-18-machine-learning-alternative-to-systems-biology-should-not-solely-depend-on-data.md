In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning has emerged as a plausible alternative to systems biology for the elucidation of biological phenomena and in attaining specified design objective in synthetic biology. Although considered highly disruptive with numerous notable successes so far, we seek to bring attention to both the fundamental and practical pitfalls of their usage, especially in illuminating emergent behaviors from chaotic or stochastic systems in biology. Without deliberating on their suitability and the required data qualities and pre-processing approaches beforehand, the research and development community could experience similar ‘AI winters’ that had plagued other fields. Instead, we anticipate the integration or combination of the two approaches, where appropriate, moving forward.
