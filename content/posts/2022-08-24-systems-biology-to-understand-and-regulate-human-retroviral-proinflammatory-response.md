description: After the human genome sequencing project, it is now well-known
  that only a very minor component of the whole genome, that is, only about 1-2%
  constitute of protein-coding genes (1). The remaining sequences make up the
  numerous transcriptional and translational regulatory components, such as
  ribosomal DNA genes, transfer RNA genes, and non-coding DNA sequences.
  Notably, in mammalian cells, about half of the non-coding DNA sequences are
  transposable elements (TEs) (2).

The majority of human genome are non-coding genes. Recent research have revealed that about half of these genome sequences make up of transposable elements (TEs). A branch of these belong to the endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which are germline viral infection that occurred over millions of years ago. They are generally harmless as evolutionary mutations have made them unable to produce viral agents and are mostly epigenetically silenced. Nevertheless, ERVs are able to express by still unknown mechanisms and recent evidences have shown links between ERVs and major proinflammatory diseases and cancers. The major challenge is to elucidate a detailed mechanistic understanding between them, so that novel therapeutic approaches can be explored. Here, we provide a brief overview of TEs, human ERVs and their links to microbiome, innate immune response, proinflammatory diseases and cancer. Finally, we recommend the employment of systems biology approaches for future HERV research.
