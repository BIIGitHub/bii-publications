description: The Eyes Absent proteins (EYA1-4) are a biochemically unique group
  of tyrosine phosphatases known to be tumour-promoting across a range of cancer
  types. To date, the targets of EYA phosphatase activity remain largely
  uncharacterised. Here, we identify Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) as an interactor
  and phosphatase substrate of EYA4 and EYA1, with pY445 on PLK1 being the
  primary target site.

The Eyes Absent proteins (EYA1-4) are a biochemically unique group of tyrosine phosphatases known to be tumour-promoting across a range of cancer types. To date, the targets of EYA phosphatase activity remain largely uncharacterised. Here, we identify Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) as an interactor and phosphatase substrate of EYA4 and EYA1, with pY445 on PLK1 being the primary target site. Dephosphorylation of pY445 in the G2 phase of the cell cycle is required for centrosome maturation, PLK1 localization to centrosomes, and polo-box domain (PBD) dependent interactions between PLK1 and PLK1-activation complexes. Molecular dynamics simulations support the rationale that pY445 confers a structural impairment to PBD-substrate interactions that is relieved by EYA-mediated dephosphorylation. Depletion of EYA4 or EYA1, or chemical inhibition of EYA phosphatase activity, dramatically reduces PLK1 activation, causing mitotic defects and cell death. Overall, we have characterized a phosphotyrosine signalling network governing PLK1 and mitosis.
