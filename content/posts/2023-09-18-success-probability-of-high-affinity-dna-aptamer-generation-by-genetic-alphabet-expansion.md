description: Nucleic acid aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules that
  bind specifically to a wide variety of targets, such as small molecules,
  sugars, proteins and cells. Aptamers are generated by an evolutionary
  engineering method called SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by
  exponential enrichment), through repetitive processes of selection and
  amplification using nucleic acid libraries with randomized sequences [1,2].
  Once the aptamer sequences have been determined by SELEX, the aptamers and
  their modifications are manufactured by solid-phase chemical synthesis and can
  be used as antibody alternatives. However, one main issue is the aptamers'
  insufficient affinities to targets, because of the limited chemical diversity,
  especially the low hydrophobicity, of the nucleic acid components, A, G, C and
  T/U, for interactions with hydrophobic regions of target proteins. Thus, the
  practical applications of nucleic acid aptamers are still limited, and many
  improved methods for modified aptamer generation have been reported [3â€“8].
  Especially, the use of a chemically expanded library is widely considered to
  be advantageous for generating high-affinity aptamers, but few studies have
  experimentally or theoretically confirmed the validity of this strategy [9].

Nucleic acid aptamers as antibody alternatives bind specifically to target molecules. These aptamers are generated by isolating candidates from libraries with random sequence fragments, through an evolutionary engineering system. We recently reported a high-affinity DNA aptamer generation method that introduces unnatural bases (UBs) as a fifth letter into the library, by genetic alphabet expansion. By incorporating hydrophobic UBs, the affinities of DNA aptamers to target proteins are increased over 100-fold, as compared with those of conventional aptamers with only the natural four letters. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement of the methods for routinely generating high-affinity UB-containing DNA (UB-DNA) aptamers. The success probabilities of the high-affinity aptamer generation depend on the existence of the aptamer candidate sequences in the initial library. We estimated the success probabilities by analysing several UB-DNA aptamers that we generated, as examples. In addition, we investigated the possible improvement of conventional aptamer affinities by introducing one UB at specific positions. Our data revealed that UB-DNA aptamers adopt specific tertiary structures, in which many bases including UBs interact with target proteins for high affinity, suggesting the importance of the UB-DNA library design.
