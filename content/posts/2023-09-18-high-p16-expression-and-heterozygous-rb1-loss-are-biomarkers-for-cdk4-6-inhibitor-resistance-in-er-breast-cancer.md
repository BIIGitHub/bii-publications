description: "CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy have
  demonstrated higher antitumor activity than endocrine therapy alone for the
  treatment of advanced estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Some of these
  tumors are de novo resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors and others develop acquired
  resistance. Here, we show that p16 overexpression is associated with reduced
  antitumor activity of CDK4/6 inhibitors in patient-derived xenografts (n = 37)
  and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines, as well as reduced
  response of early and advanced breast cancer patients to CDK4/6 inhibitors
  (n = 89). "

CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy have demonstrated higher antitumor activity than endocrine therapy alone for the treatment of advanced estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Some of these tumors are de novo resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors and others develop acquired resistance. Here, we show that p16 overexpression is associated with reduced antitumor activity of CDK4/6 inhibitors in patient-derived xenografts (*n* = 37) and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines, as well as reduced response of early and advanced breast cancer patients to CDK4/6 inhibitors (*n* = 89). We also identified heterozygous *RB1* loss as biomarker of acquired resistance and poor clinical outcome. Combination of the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib with the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib showed antitumor activity in estrogen receptor-positive non-basal-like breast cancer patient-derived xenografts, independently of *PIK3CA*, *ESR1* or *RB1* mutation, also in drug de-escalation experiments or omitting endocrine therapy. Our results offer insights into predicting primary/acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors and post-progression therapeutic strategies.
