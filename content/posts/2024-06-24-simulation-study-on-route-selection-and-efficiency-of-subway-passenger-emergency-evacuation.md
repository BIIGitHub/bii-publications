In an emergency situation where passengers need to evacuate from a subway station, an efficient evacuation route can reduce the risk of secondary injuries by avoiding congestion. This paper investigated how the behavioral characteristics and path selection rules of passengers in emergency situations affect the evacuation efficiency of subway stations. Frequency analysis, cluster analysis, and crossover analysis of subway passengers' evacuation behavior, familiarity degree, and route selection were conducted through a questionnaire survey. Based on these findings, Anylogic software was used to establish a social force model with a path selection module and simulate the efficiency of different evacuation schemes for passengers. The results show that evacuation behavior is significantly influenced by certain fundamental characteristics of passengers and their familiarity with the subway station. Furthermore, directing passengers towards longer and less crowded routes instead of the nearest ones can significantly improve evacuation efficiency. And the intermediate phase of the evacuation process is particularly susceptible to overcrowding, necessitating enhanced emergency management measures by subway station personnel during this period.
