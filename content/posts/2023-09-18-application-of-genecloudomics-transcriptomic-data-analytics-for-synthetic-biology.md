Research in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering require a deep understanding on the function and regulation of complex pathway genes. This can be achieved through gene expression profiling which quantifies the transcriptome-wide expression under any condition, such as a cell development stage, mutant, disease, or treatment with a drug. The expression profiling is usually done using high-throughput techniques such as RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) or microarray. Although both methods are based on different technical approaches, they provide quantitative measures of the expression levels of thousands of genes. The expression levels of the genes are compared under different conditions to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the genes with different expression levels under different conditions. DEGs, usually involving thousands in number, are then investigated using bioinformatics and data analytic tools to infer and compare their functional roles between conditions. Dealing with such large datasets, therefore, requires intensive data processing and analyses to ensure its quality and produce results that are statistically sound. Thus, there is a need for deep statistical and bioinformatics knowledge to deal with high-throughput gene expression data. This represents a barrier for wet biologists with limited computational, programming, and data analytic skills that prevent them from getting the full potential of the data. In this chapter, we present a step-by-step protocol to perform transcriptome analysis using GeneCloudOmics, a cloud-based web server that provides an end-to-end platform for high-throughput gene expression analysis.
