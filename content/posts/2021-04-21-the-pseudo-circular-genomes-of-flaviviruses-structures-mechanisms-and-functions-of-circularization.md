The circularization of viral genomes fulfills various functions, from evading host defense mechanisms to promoting specific replication and translation patterns supporting viral proliferation. Here, we describe the genomic structures and associated host factors important for flaviviruses genome circularization and summarize their functional roles. Flaviviruses are relatively small, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with genomes of approximately 11 kb in length. These genomes contain motifs at their 5′ and 3′ ends, as well as in other regions, that are involved in circularization. These motifs are highly conserved throughout the Flavivirus genus and occur both in mature virions and within infected cells. We provide an overview of these sequence motifs and RNA structures involved in circularization, describe their linear and circularized structures, and discuss the proteins that interact with these circular structures and that promote and regulate their formation, aiming to clarify the key features of genome circularization and understand how these affect the flaviviruses life cycle
