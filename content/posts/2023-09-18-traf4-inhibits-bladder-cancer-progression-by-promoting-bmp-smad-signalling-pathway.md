description: Bladder cancer is a highly prevalent cancer with poor clinical
  outcomes, especially in advanced stages of progression when the cancer starts
  invading the bladder muscle (1). Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  has been implicated in bladder cancer progression and metastasis. EMT is a
  dynamic process in which epithelial cells lose their cell–cell contacts and
  apical–basal polarity and gain mesenchymal traits with increased migration and
  invasion abilities (2, 3). Cells lose the expression of epithelial markers
  such as E-cadherin and gain the expression of mesenchymal markers such as
  N-cadherin (4). This process is orchestrated by EMT-inducing transcription
  factors, including SNAIL and SLUG (5, 6). TGFβ signaling pathway is known to
  stimulate EMT (7).

Patients with bladder cancer often have a poor prognosis due to the highly invasive and metastatic characteristics of bladder cancer cells. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been causally linked to bladder cancer invasion. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 4 (TRAF4) has been implicated as a tumor promoter in a wide range of cancers. In contrast, here we show that low TRAF4 expression is associated with poor overall survival in patients with bladder cancer. We show that the *TRAF4* gene is epigenetically silenced and that ERK mediates TRAF4 phosphorylation, resulting in lower TRAF4 protein levels in bladder cancer cells. In addition, we demonstrate that TRAF4 is inversely correlated with an EMT gene signature/protein marker expression. Functionally, by manipulating TRAF4 expression, we show that TRAF4 regulates EMT genes and epithelial and invasive properties in bladder cancer cells. Transcriptomic analysis of dysregulated TRAF4 expression in bladder cancer cell lines revealed that high TRAF4 expression enhances the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD and inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway. Mechanistically, we show that TRAF4 targets the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF1, a negative regulator of BMP/SMAD signaling, for proteasomal degradation in bladder cancer cells. This was corroborated in patient samples where TRAF4 positively correlates with phospho-SMAD1/5, and negatively correlates with phospho-NFκb-p65. Lastly, we show that genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of SMURF1 inhibits the migration of aggressive mesenchymal bladder cancer cells.
