description: Intrinsically disordered proteins and peptides (IDPs) do not adopt
  stable secondary or tertiary structures, and are best structurally
  characterised as ensembles of flexible conformations.1 While the traditional
  paradigm holds that biological processes are mediated by macromolecules with
  fixed three-dimensional structures, it is now becoming increasingly evident
  that IDPs play a very important role.2 In the absence of a stable structure
  and characterised by high levels of flexibility, IDPs can easily interconvert
  between multiple conformations. This enables them to bind to different
  macromolecules, resulting in diverse functionality.2–6 For example, the
  intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation domain of the protein p53
  is structured into a helix upon binding to a hydrophobic cleft in the proteins
  MDM2 or p300.3,7–9 Similarly the disordered C-terminal region of p53 has been
  shown to adopt diverse secondary structures when complexed to different
  protein partners.10 The study of the structural dynamics of IDPs and their
  participation in protein–protein interactions (PPIs) using computational and
  experimental studies is increasingly illuminating the subtle yet complex
  nature of molecular interactions governing biomolecular mechanisms.

Understanding the conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins and peptides (IDPs) in their various biological environments is essential for understanding their mechanisms and functional roles in the proteome, leading to a greater knowledge of, and potential treatments for, a broad range of diseases. To determine whether molecular simulation is able to generate accurate conformational ensembles of IDPs, we explore the structural landscape of the PLP peptide (an intrinsically disordered region of the proteolipid membrane protein) in aqueous and membrane-mimicking solvents, using replica exchange with solute scaling (REST2), and examine the ability of four force fields (ff14SB, ff14IDPSFF, CHARMM36 and CHARMM36m) to reproduce literature circular dichroism (CD) data. Results from variable temperature (VT) 1H and Rotating frame Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY (ROESY) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments are also presented and are consistent with the structural observations obtained from the simulations and CD. We also apply the optimum simulation protocol to TP2 and ONEG (a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) and a negative control peptide, respectively) to gain insight into the structural differences that may account for the observed difference in their membrane-penetrating abilities. Of the tested force fields, we find that CHARMM36 and CHARMM36m are best suited to the study of IDPs, and accurately predict a disordered to helical conformational transition of the PLP peptide accompanying the change from aqueous to membrane-mimicking solvents. We also identify an α-helical structure of TP2 in the membrane-mimicking solvents and provide a discussion of the mechanistic implications of this observation with reference to the previous literature on the peptide. From these results, we recommend the use of CHARMM36m with the REST2 protocol for the study of environment-specific IDP conformations. We believe that the simulation protocol will allow the study of a broad range of IDPs that undergo conformational transitions in different biological environments.
