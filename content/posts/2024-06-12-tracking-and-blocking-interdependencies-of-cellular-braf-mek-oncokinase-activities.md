The selective targeting of mutated kinases in cancer therapies has the potential to improve therapeutic success and thereby the survival of patients. In the case of melanoma, the constitutively active MAPK pathway is targeted by a combinatorial inhibition of BRAF and MEK activities. These MAPK pathway players may display patient-specific differences in the onco-kinase mutation spectrum, which needs to be considered for the design of more efficient personalized therapies. Here, we extend a bioluminescence-based kinase conformation biosensor (KinCon) to allow for live-cell tracking of interconnected kinase activity states. First, we show that common MEK1 patient mutations promote a structural rearrangement of the kinase to an opened and active conformation. This effect was reversible by the binding of MEK inhibitors to mutated MEK1, as shown in biosensor assays and molecular dynamics simulations. Second, we implement a novel application of the KinCon technology for tracking the simultaneous, vertical targeting of the two functionally linked kinases BRAF and MEK1. Thus, we demonstrate that, in the presence of constitutively active BRAF-V600E, specific inhibitors of both kinases are efficient in driving MEK1 into a closed, inactive conformation state. We compare current melanoma treatments and show that combinations of BRAFi and MEKi display a more pronounced structural change of the drug sensor than the respective single agents, thereby identifying synergistic effects among these drug combinations. In summary, we depict the extension of the KinCon biosensor technology to systematically validate, anticipate, and personalize tailored drug arrangements using a multiplexed setup.
