description: Biomimetic membranes incorporating artificial water channels (AWCs)
  are being developed for industrial water purification. Designing AWCs to
  achieve high water permeation with salt rejection is a challenge. We designed
  and synthesized oligourea foldamers, which form predictable helical structures
  that can be used to create biomimetic porin-like architectures. Two of these
  foldamers (H2OC1 and H2OC2) allow superior water permeability and almost total
  salt rejection across lipid membranes. Solid-state NMR, cryo-EM, and molecular
  dynamics analyses suggest proper insertion of foldamers into lipid vesicles.
  The H2OC1 crystal structure shows hydrophilic pores of diameters 4.8 and 6.4
  Å. The oligourea helices pack together by hydrophobic and salt bridge
  interactions to build two channel-like assemblies. Besides their proteolytic
  stability and microbial resistance, the sequence of foldamers can be tailored
  to regulate selectivity. The ease of designing, synthesizing, and purifying
  oligourea foldamers is an added advantage. Our findings can help to develop
  novel AWCs for water purification applications.

Water scarcity is a global problem. Although reverse osmosis is an effective method for water purification, it is costly and energy intensive. To address this issue, previously, biomimetic membranes have been developed that are embedded with aquaporins (AQPs) or artificial water channels (AWCs). We designed and synthesized helical amphipathic oligourea foldamers as a new class of AWCs that can be a promising alternative to AQPs. Our foldamer monomers do not have a tubular structure, but they self-assemble, generating void space that acts as transmembrane channels, which exhibit selective water permeability. The crystal packing of one of these foldamers shows a porin-like superstructure with a hydrophilic pore of 4.8 Å diameter. The known resistance of oligoureas to proteolytic degradation suggests that they offer long-term stability. Sequence-based tunability of their properties along with their large-scale synthesis can make them a new class of AWCs for water purification.
