  The intriguing relationship between microbiota and human psyche showed gut
  microbiota to be associated with well-being. To determine if the microbiota of
  other body parts would be similarly associated, we analyzed the perceived
  stress, well-being, and happiness scale measures of 106 healthy individuals
  and their aerotolerant microbiota load in their otorhino canals.

The intriguing relationship between microbiota and human psyche showed gut microbiota to be associated with well-being. To determine if the microbiota of other body parts would be similarly associated, we analyzed the perceived stress, well-being, and happiness scale measures of 106 healthy individuals and their aerotolerant microbiota load in their otorhino canals. We found that both the perceived stress and well-being of the participants were associated with their otorhino microbial counts, but not their happiness scale scores. Women were found to have significantly less microbiota counts, lower well-being and higher levels of stress. This study is one of the first few to investigate new microbiota reservoirs in humans using aerobic body locations for psychobiological studies.
