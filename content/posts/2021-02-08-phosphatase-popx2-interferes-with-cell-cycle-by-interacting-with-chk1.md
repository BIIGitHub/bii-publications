Protein–protein interaction network analysis plays critical roles in predicting the functions of target proteins. In this study, we used a combination of SILAC-MS proteomics and bioinformatic approaches to identify Checkpoint Kinase 1 (Chk1) as a possible POPX2 phosphatase interacting protein. POPX2 is a PP2C phosphatase that has been implicated in cancer cell invasion and migration. From the Domain–Domain Interaction (DDI) database, we first determined that the PP2C phosphatase domain interacts with Pkinase domain. Subsequently, 46 proteins with Pkinase domain were identified from POPX2 SILAC-MS data. We then narrowed down the leads and confirmed the biological interaction between Chk1 and POPX2. We also found that Chk1 is a substrate of POPX2. Chk1 is a key regulator of the cell cycle and is activated when the cell suffers DNA damage. Our approach has led us to identify POPX2 as a regulator of Chk1 and can interfere with the normal function of Chk1 at G1-S transition of the cell cycle in response to DNA damage.
