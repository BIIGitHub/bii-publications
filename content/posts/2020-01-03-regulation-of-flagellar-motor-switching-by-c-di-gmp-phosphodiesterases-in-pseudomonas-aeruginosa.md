  The second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) plays a prominent role in
  regulating flagellum-dependent motility in the single-flagellated pathogenic
  bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The c-di-GMP–mediated signaling pathways and
  mechanisms that control flagellar output remain to be fully unveiled. Studying
  surface-tethered and free-swimming P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells, we found that the
  overexpression of an exogenous diguanylate cyclase (DGC) raises the global
  cellular c-di-GMP concentration and thereby inhibits flagellar motor switching
  and decreases motor speed, reducing swimming speed and reversal frequency,
  respectively.

The second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) plays a prominent role in regulating flagellum-dependent motility in the single-flagellated pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The c-di-GMP–mediated signaling pathways and mechanisms that control flagellar output remain to be fully unveiled. Studying surface-tethered and free-swimming P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells, we found that the overexpression of an exogenous diguanylate cyclase (DGC) raises the global cellular c-di-GMP concentration and thereby inhibits flagellar motor switching and decreases motor speed, reducing swimming speed and reversal frequency, respectively. We noted that the inhibiting effect of c-di-GMP on flagellar motor switching, but not motor speed, is exerted through the c-di-GMP–binding adaptor protein MapZ and associated chemotactic pathways. Among the 22 putative c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases, we found that three of them (DipA, NbdA, and RbdA) can significantly inhibit flagellar motor switching and swimming directional reversal in a MapZ-dependent manner. These results disclose a network of c-di-GMP–signaling proteins that regulate chemotactic responses and flagellar motor switching in P. aeruginosa and establish MapZ as a key signaling hub that integrates inputs from different c-di-GMP–signaling pathways to control flagellar output and bacterial motility. We rationalized these experimental findings by invoking a model that postulates the regulation of flagellar motor switching by subcellular c-di-GMP pools.
