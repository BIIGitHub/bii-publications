  Atopic eczema (AE) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory skin condition that
  affects approximately 15–20% of children worldwide (Nutten, 2015). The
  prevalence varies widely among different countries, between rural and urban
  areas within a single country, and particular Asian skin types are more
  sensitive to urban environments (Ben-Gashir et al., 2004, Krutmann et al.,
  2014, Nutten, 2015, Odhiambo et al., 2009). In this study, we analyzed the
  genetic architecture of patients with AE from the South Asian Bangladeshi
  community in East London, UK using whole-exome sequencing combined with rare
  variant enrichment analysis.

Atopic eczema (AE) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects approximately 15–20% of children worldwide (Nutten, 2015). The prevalence varies widely among different countries, between rural and urban areas within a single country, and particular Asian skin types are more sensitive to urban environments (Ben-Gashir et al., 2004, Krutmann et al., 2014, Nutten, 2015, Odhiambo et al., 2009). In this study, we analyzed the genetic architecture of patients with AE from the South Asian Bangladeshi community in East London, UK using whole-exome sequencing combined with rare variant enrichment analysis. A total of 70 Bangladeshi Sylheti families, each with at least two affected siblings presenting with severe AE (determined by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines), were recruited via the pediatric dermatology clinic at the Royal London Hospital, London, UK. The majority of the affected individuals were born in the United Kingdom and also presented with very high IgE levels and other atopic phenotypes, such as food allergy, asthma, and hay fever.Atopic eczema (AE) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects approximately 15–20% of children worldwide (Nutten, 2015).
