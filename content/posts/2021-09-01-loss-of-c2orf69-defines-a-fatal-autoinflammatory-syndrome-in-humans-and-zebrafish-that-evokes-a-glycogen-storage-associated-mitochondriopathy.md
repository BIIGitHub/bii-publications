Human *C2orf69* is an evolutionarily conserved gene whose function is unknown. Here, we report eight unrelated families from which 20 children presented with a fatal syndrome consisting of severe autoinflammation and progredient leukoencephalopathy with recurrent seizures; 12 of these subjects, whose DNA was available, segregated homozygous loss-of-function *C2orf69* variants. C2ORF69 bears homology to [esterase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/esterase "Learn more about esterase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") enzymes, and orthologs can be found in most eukaryotic genomes, including that of unicellular [phytoplankton](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/phytoplankton "Learn more about phytoplankton from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). We found that endogenous C2ORF69 (1) is loosely bound to mitochondria, (2) affects [mitochondrial membrane potential](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mitochondrial-membrane-potential "Learn more about mitochondrial membrane potential from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and oxidative respiration in [cultured neurons](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/nerve-cell-culture "Learn more about cultured neurons from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and (3) controls the levels of the [glycogen branching enzyme](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/glycogen-branching-enzyme "Learn more about glycogen branching enzyme from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") 1 (GBE1) consistent with a glycogen-storage-associated mitochondriopathy. We show that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated inactivation of zebrafish *C2orf69* results in lethality by 8 months of age due to spontaneous epileptic seizures, which is preceded by persistent brain inflammation. Collectively, our results delineate an autoinflammatory Mendelian disorder of *C2orf69* deficiency that disrupts the development/homeostasis of the immune and central nervous systems.
