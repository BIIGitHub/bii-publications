description: Lates calcarifer, also known as Barramundi or Asian seabass, is a
  highly productive and fast-growing species that is well suited to large-scale
  aquaculture due to its attractive harvestable yields (premium fish). This fish
  has been envisioned as having the potential to be the “Salmon of Tropics”.
  Cultivating Lates calcarifer in aquaculture poses challenges, as the dense
  populations that make such aquaculture commercially viable facilitate the
  rapid spread of infectious diseases, which in turn significantly impact yield

Lates calcarifer, also known as Barramundi or Asian seabass, is a highly productive and fast-growing species that is well suited to large-scale aquaculture due to its attractive harvestable yields (premium fish). This fish has been envisioned as having the potential to be the “Salmon of Tropics”. Cultivating Lates calcarifer in aquaculture poses challenges, as the dense populations that make such aquaculture commercially viable facilitate the rapid spread of infectious diseases, which in turn significantly impact yield. Hence, the immunization of juveniles is necessary, and the development of new immunization agents enhances the efficiency of aquaculture and improves food security. In our study, we characterize seven novel strains of the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus iniae that were collected from commercial fish farms in Singapore and Australia. We find that the capsular operon in our strains is highly conserved and identify a number of major surface antigens previously described in Streptococcus. A genome analysis indicates that the present strains are closely related but form distinct strains within the S. iniae species. We then proceed to demonstrate that inoculation with the inactivated strain P3SAB cross-protects Lates calcarifer against S. iniae infections in vivo from a variety of strains found in both Singapore and Australia.
