description: The dramatic rise in obesity and diabetes in recent decades has
  seen the widespread use of artificial sweeteners in food and drinks as sugar
  replacements (Gardner et al., 2012). By replacing sugar with these artificial
  sweeteners, blood glucose level can be better regulated and calorie
  consumption reduced whilst maintaining food palatability with its sweet taste
  (Gardner et al., 2012). However, recent data around the detrimental side
  effects of consuming artificial sweeteners highlight the need for other
  sweeteners (Bueno-Hern√°ndez et al., 2019, Debras et al., 2022, Debras et al.,
  2022, Suez et al., 2014).

With growing concerns over the health impact of sugar, brazzein offers a viable alternative due to its sweetness, thermostability, and low risk profile. Here, we demonstrated the ability of protein language models to design new brazzein homologs with improved thermostability and potentially higher sweetness, resulting in new diverse optimized amino acid sequences that improve structural and functional features beyond what conventional methods could achieve. This innovative approach resulted in the identification of unexpected mutations, thereby generating new possibilities for protein engineering. To facilitate the characterization of the brazzein mutants, a simplified procedure was developed for expressing and analyzing related proteins. This process involved an efficient [purification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/copurification "Learn more about purification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") method using *Lactococcus lactis* (*L. lactis*), a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) bacterium, as well as taste receptor assays to evaluate sweetness. The study successfully demonstrated the potential of computational design in producing a more heat-resistant and potentially more palatable brazzein variant, V23.
