  Underrepresentation of Asian genomes has hindered population and  medical
  genetics research on Asians, leading to population disparities in precision
  medicine. By whole-genome sequencing of 4,810 Singapore Chinese, Malays, and
  Indians, we found 98.3 million SNPs and small insertions or deletions, over
  half of which  are novel. Population structure analysis demonstrated great
  representation of  Asian genetic diversity by three ethnicities in Singapore
  and revealed a  Malay-related novel ancestry component.

Underrepresentation of Asian genomes has hindered population and medical genetics research on Asians, leading to population disparities in precision medicine. By whole-genome sequencing of 4,810 Singapore Chinese, Malays, and Indians, we found 98.3 million SNPs and small insertions or deletions,  over half of which are novel. Population structure analysis demonstrated great representation of Asian genetic diversity by three ethnicities in Singapore and revealed a Malay-related novel ancestry component. Furthermore, demographic inference suggested that Malays split from Chinese ∼24,800 years ago and experienced significant admixture with East Asians ∼1,700 years ago, coinciding with the Austronesian expansion. Additionally, we identified 20 candidate loci for natural selection, 14 of which harbored robust associations with complex traits and diseases. Finally, we show  that our data can substantially improve genotype imputation in diverse Asian and Oceanian populations. These results highlight the value of our data
as a resource to empower human genetics discovery across broad geographic regions.
