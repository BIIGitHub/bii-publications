  Underrepresentation of Asian genomes has hindered population and 
  medical genetics research on Asians, leading to population disparities in precision
  medicine. By whole-genome sequencing of 4,810 Singapore Chinese, Malays, and Indians,
  we found 98.3 million SNPs and small insertions or deletions, over half of which 
  are novel. Population structure analysis demonstrated great representation of 
  Asian genetic diversity by three ethnicities in Singapore and revealed a 
  Malay-related novel ancestry component. Furthermore, demographic inference suggested 
  that Malays split from Chinese ∼24,800 years ago and experienced significant admixture
  with East Asians ∼1,700 years ago, coinciding with the Austronesian expansion. 
  Additionally, we identified 20 candidate loci for natural selection, 14 of which 
  harbored robust associations with complex traits and diseases. Finally, we show 
  that our data can substantially improve genotype imputation in diverse Asian and 
  Oceanian populations. These results highlight the value of our data as a resource 
  to empower human genetics discovery across broad geographic regions.
