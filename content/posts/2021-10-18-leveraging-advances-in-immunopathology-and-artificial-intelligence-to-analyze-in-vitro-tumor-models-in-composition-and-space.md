Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. Unfortunately, efforts to understand this disease are confounded by the complex, heterogenous tumor microenvironment (TME). Better understanding of the TME could lead to novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic discoveries. One way to achieve this involves *in vitro* tumor models that recapitulate the *in vivo* TME composition and spatial arrangement. Here, we review the potential of harnessing *in vitro* tumor models and artificial intelligence to delineate the TME. This includes (i) identification of novel features, (ii) investigation of higher-order relationships, and (iii) analysis and interpretation of multiomics data in a (iv) holistic, objective, reproducible, and efficient manner, which surpasses previous methods of TME analysis. We also discuss limitations of this approach, namely inadequate datasets, indeterminate biological correlations, ethical concerns, and logistical constraints; finally, we speculate on future avenues of research that could overcome these limitations, ultimately translating to improved clinical outcomes.
