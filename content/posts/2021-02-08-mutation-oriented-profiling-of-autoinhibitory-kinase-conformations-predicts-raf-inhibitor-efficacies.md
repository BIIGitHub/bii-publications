description: The pharmaceutical targeting of mutated BRAF has shown promising
  clinical outcomes in patients with melanoma. However, more than 300 reported
  BRAF patient mutations and the occurrence of a kinase-drug resistance
  mechanism hamper patient-oriented therapies. We have developed an extendable
  and cell-based kinase conformation reporter platform (KinCon) to predict and
  compare the effect of kinase drugs. We systematically evaluated drug
  efficacies by assessing KinCon reporter dynamics in response to different
  drugs and patient mutations. Our findings suggest that FDA-approved melanoma
  inhibitors may have the potential to block non-V600E–mutated BRAF activities
  also in non–small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC). We assume that widespread
  analyses of KinCon:drug interactions may assist in the future in identifying
  patient mutation–specific and thus more effective kinase inhibitors.

Kinase-targeted therapies have the potential to improve the survival of patients with cancer. However, the cancer-specific spectrum of kinase alterations exhibits distinct functional properties and requires mutation-oriented drug treatments. Besides post-translational modifications and diverse intermolecular interactions of kinases, it is the distinct disease mutation which reshapes full-length kinase conformations, affecting their activity. Oncokinase mutation profiles differ between cancer types, as it was shown for BRAF in melanoma and non–small-cell lung cancers. Here, we present the target-oriented application of a kinase conformation (KinCon) reporter platform for live-cell measurements of autoinhibitory kinase activity states. The bioluminescence-based KinCon biosensor allows the tracking of conformation dynamics of full-length kinases in intact cells and real time. We show that the most frequent BRAF cancer mutations affect kinase conformations and thus the engagement and efficacy of V600E-specific BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). We illustrate that the patient mutation harboring KinCon reporters display differences in the effectiveness of the three clinically approved BRAFi vemurafenib, encorafenib, and dabrafenib and the preclinical paradox breaker PLX8394. We confirmed KinCon-based drug efficacy predictions for BRAF mutations other than V600E in proliferation assays using patient-derived lung cancer cell lines and by analyzing downstream kinase signaling. The systematic implementation of such conformation reporters will allow to accelerate the decision process for the mutation-oriented RAF-kinase cancer therapy. Moreover, we illustrate that the presented kinase reporter concept can be extended to other kinases which harbor patient mutations. Overall, KinCon profiling provides additional mechanistic insights into full-length kinase functions by reporting protein–protein interaction (PPI)-dependent, mutation-specific, and drug-driven changes of kinase activity conformations.
