Across many scientific disciplines, the development of computational models and algorithms for generating artificial or synthetic data is gaining momentum. In biology, there is a great opportunity to explore this further as more and more big data at multi-omics level are generated recently. In this opinion, we discuss the latest trends in biological applications based on process-driven and data-driven aspects. Moving ahead, we believe these methodologies can help shape novel multi-omics-scale cellular inferences.
