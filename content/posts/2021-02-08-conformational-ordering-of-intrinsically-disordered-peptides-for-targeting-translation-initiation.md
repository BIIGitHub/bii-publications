### Background

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in proteins can regulate their activity by facilitating protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as exemplified in the recruitment of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) protein by the protein eIF4G. Deregulation of this PPI module is central to a broad spectrum of cancer related malignancies and its targeted inhibition through bioactive peptides is a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention.

### Methods

We employed molecular dynamics simulations coupled with biophysical assays to rationally develop peptide derivatives from the intrinsically disordered eIF4G scaffold by incorporating non-natural amino acids that facilitates disorder-to-order transition.

### Results

The conformational heterogeneity of these peptides and the degree of structural reorganization required to adopt the optimum mode of interaction with eIF4E underscores their differential binding affinities. The presence of a pre-structured local helical element in the ensemble of structures was instrumental in the efficient docking of the peptides on to the protein surface. The formation of Y4: P38 hydrogen-bond interaction between the peptide and eIF4E is a rate limiting event in the efficient recognition of the protein since it occurs through the disordered region of the peptide.

### Conclusions

These insights were exploited to further design features into the peptide to propagate bound-state conformations in solution which resulted in the generation of a potent eIF4E binder.

### General significance

The study illustrates the molecular basis of eIF4E recognition by a disordered epitope from eIF4G and its modulation to generate peptides that can potentially attenuate translation initiation in oncology.
