description: Mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinases 1 and 2
  (MNK1/2) represent a central class of enzymes that are activated by
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or p38 mitogen-activated protein
  (MAP) kinases. MNK1 and MNK2 coordinate cellular signaling, control production
  of inflammatory chemokines, and regulate cell proliferation and survival.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinases 1 and 2 (MNK1/2) represent a central class of enzymes that are activated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. MNK1 and MNK2 coordinate cellular signaling, control production of inflammatory chemokines, and regulate cell proliferation and survival. MNK1/2 are referred to as serine/threonine kinases as they phosphorylate serine or threonine residues on their substrates. Upon activation, MNK1/2 phosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) at Ser209, which in turn initiates ribosome assembly and protein translation. Deleterious overexpression of MNK1/2 and/or eIF4E have been reported in several diseases including cancers, neurological disorders, autism, and inflammation. Recently, there have been intense efforts toward the development of potent and selective inhibitors of MNK1/2 in both academia and industry. Herein, we review the current understanding of the structural and biological aspects of MNK1/2 and provide an update of pharmacological inhibitors of MNK1/2 including candidates in clinical trials.
