Promising results in clinical studies have been demonstrated by the utilization of electrothermal agents (ETAs) in cancer therapy. However, a difficulty arises from the balance between facilitating the degradation of ETAs, and at the same time, increasing the electrothermal performance/stability required for highly efficient treatment. In this study, we controlled the thermal signature of the MoS2 by harnessing MoS2 nanostructures with M13 phage (MNM) via the structural assembling (hydrophobic interaction) phenomena and developed a combined PANC-1 cancer cell–MNM alternating current (AC)-stimulus framework for cancer cell ablation and electrothermal therapy. A percentage decrease in the cell viability of ~23% was achieved, as well as a degradation time of 2 weeks; a stimulus length of 100 μs was also achieved. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed the assembling kinetics in integrated M13 phage–cancer cell protein systems and the structural origin of the hydrophobic interaction-enabled increase in thermal conduction. This study not only introduced an ‘ideal’ agent that avoided the limitations of ETAs but also provided a proof-of-concept application of MoS2-based materials in efficacious cancer therapy.
