[Chitin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/chitin "Learn more about Chitin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is a major component of various wastes such as crustacean shells, [filamentous fungi](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/filamentous-fungus "Learn more about filamentous fungi from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and insects. Recently, food-safe biological and chemical processes converting chitin to [glucosamine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/glucosamine "Learn more about glucosamine from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") have been developed. Here, we studied microalgae that can uptake glucosamine as vital carbon and nitrogen sources for valuable alternative protein biomass. Utilizing data mining and bioinformatics analysis, we identified 29 species that contain the required [enzymes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/enzyme "Learn more about enzymes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for glucosamine to glucose conversion. The growth performance of the selected strains was examined, and glucosamine was used in different forms and concentrations. Glucose at a concentration of 2.5 g/L was required to initiate glucosamine metabolic degradation by [Chlorella vulgaris](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/chlorella-vulgaris "Learn more about Chlorella vulgaris from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and [Chlorella sorokiniana](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/chlorella-sorokiniana "Learn more about Chlorella sorokiniana from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Glucosamine HCl and glucosamine phosphate showed maximum cell counts of about 8.5 and 9.0 log/mL for C. *sorokiniana* and *C. vulgaris* in 14 days, respectively. [Enzymatic hydrolysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/enzymatic-hydrolysis "Learn more about Enzymatic hydrolysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of glucosamine increased growth performance with *C. sorokiniana* by about 3 folds. The adapted strains were fast-growing and could double their dry biomasses during the same [incubation time](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/incubation-time "Learn more about incubation time from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). In addition, adapted *C. sorokiniana* was able to tolerate three times glucosamine concentration in the medium. The study illustrated possible strategies for employing *C. sorokiniana* and *C. vulgaris* to convert glucosamine into valuable biomass in a more sustainable way.
