  Viscosity sensitive fluorophores termed 'molecular rotors' represent a
  convenient and quantitative tool for measuring intracellular viscosity via
  Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM). We compare the FLIM
  performance of two BODIPY-based molecular rotors bound to HaloTag protein
  expressed in different subcellular locations. While both rotors are able to
  penetrate live cells and specifically label the desired intracellular
  location, we found that the rotor with a longer HaloTag protein recognition
  motif was significantly affected by photo-induced damage when bound to the
  HaloTag protein, while the other dye showed no changes upon irradiation.
  Molecular dynamics modelling indicates that the irradiation-induced electron
  transfer between the BODIPY moiety and the HaloTag protein is a plausible
  explanation for these photostability issues. Our results demonstrate that
  binding to the targeted protein may significantly alter the photophysical
  behaviour of a fluorescent probe and therefore its thorough characterisation
  in the protein bound form is essential prior to any in vitro and in cellulo
  applications.
