description: The mosquito-borne flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and
  Zika virus (ZIKV) have established themselves as major human pathogens. Live
  attenuated vaccines are seen as the most effective method for preventing
  flavivirus infection. Flavivirus genome recoding has emerged as a
  next-generation vaccine development method that acts by rewriting the
  flavivirus genome. Previous flavivirus genome recoding attempts were based on
  deoptimising the flavivirus genome. However, these deoptimised flaviviruses
  were found to be attenuated in a species dependent manner. For example,
  deoptimised DENV and ZIKV did not demonstrate attenuation in mosquito cells or
  mosquito animal models, which is undesirable because these mosquito-borne
  flaviviruses should be attenuated in their mosquito vector to prevent vaccine
  escape. To overcome these limitations, we adopted a flavivirus genome recoding
  approach based on the contrary approach of optimising the flavivirus genome
  and applied it to DENV2 and ZIKV. We found that this genome recoding approach
  of codon optimisation could confer attenuation in both mouse and mosquito
  animal models. This indicates that our flavivirus genome recoding approach may
  be used as a reliable method to construct attenuated vaccine backbones for the
  mosquito-borne-flaviviruses in general.

Virus genome recoding is an attenuation method that confers genetically stable attenuation by rewriting a virus genome with numerous silent mutations. Prior flavivirus genome recoding attempts utilised codon deoptimisation approaches. However, these codon deoptimisation approaches act in a species dependent manner and were unable to confer flavivirus attenuation in mosquito cells or in mosquito animal models. To overcome these limitations, we performed flavivirus genome recoding using the contrary approach of codon optimisation. The genomes of flaviviruses such as dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) and Zika virus (ZIKV) contain functional RNA elements that regulate viral replication. We hypothesised that flavivirus genome recoding by codon optimisation would introduce silent mutations that disrupt these RNA elements, leading to decreased replication efficiency and attenuation. We chose DENV2 and ZIKV as representative flaviviruses and recoded them by codon optimising their genomes for human expression. Our study confirms that this recoding approach of codon optimisation does translate into reduced replication efficiency in mammalian, human, and mosquito cells as well as *in vivo* attenuation in both mice and mosquitoes. *In silico* modelling and RNA SHAPE analysis confirmed that DENV2 recoding resulted in the extensive disruption of genomic structural elements. Serial passaging of recoded DENV2 resulted in the emergence of rescue or adaptation mutations, but no reversion mutations. These rescue mutations were unable to rescue the delayed replication kinetics and *in vivo* attenuation of recoded DENV2, demonstrating that recoding confers genetically stable attenuation. Therefore, our recoding approach is a reliable attenuation method with potential applications for developing flavivirus vaccines.
