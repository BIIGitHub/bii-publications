description: Atopic dermatitis (a type of eczema) is an itchy and painful
  inflammatory skin disorder of unknown cause, which is associated with
  decreased function of T cell signaling mediator CARD11 in some patients. Loh
  et al. found that a scaffolding protein may contribute to CARD11 repression
  and increased severity of atopic dermatitis symptoms in mice. The scaffolding
  protein DOK3, which was abundant in patient blood cells and bound strongly to
  patient-derived CARD11 variants, recruited the phosphatase PP4C to CARD11,
  functionally inactivating it and impairing T cell regulation. Reducing DOK3
  abundance alleviated the symptoms in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis. Thus,
  the strength of the DOK3-CARD11 interaction may predict symptom severity in
  atopic dermatitis patients.

The scaffolding protein CARD11 is a critical mediator of antigen receptor signaling in lymphocytes. Hypomorphic (partial loss-of-function) mutations in CARD11 are associated with the development of severe atopic dermatitis, in which T cell receptor signaling is reduced and helper T cell differentiation is skewed to an allergy-associated type 2 phenotype. Here, we found that the docking protein DOK3 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis by suppressing CARD11 activity. DOK3 interacted with CARD11 and decreased its phosphorylation in T cells by recruiting the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 4, thereby dampening downstream signaling. Knocking out *Dok3* enhanced the production of the cytokine IFN-γ by T cells, which conferred protection against experimental atopic dermatitis–like skin inflammation in mice. The expression of *DOK3* was increased in T cells isolated from patients with atopic dermatitis and inversely correlated with *IFNG* expression. A subset of hypomorphic CARD11 variants found in patients with atopic dermatitis bound more strongly than wild-type CARD11 to DOK3. Our findings suggest that the strength of the interaction of DOK3 with CARD11 may predispose individuals to developing atopic dermatitis.
