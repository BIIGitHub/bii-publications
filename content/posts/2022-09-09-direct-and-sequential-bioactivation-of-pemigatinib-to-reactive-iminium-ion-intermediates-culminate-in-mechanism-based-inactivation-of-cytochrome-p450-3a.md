description: Significance Statement In this study, we reported for the first
  time the covalent MBI of CYP3A by PEM and deciphered its bioactivation pathway
  involving the metabolic activation of PEM and its major O-desmethylated
  metabolite to reactive iminium ion intermediates. Following which, a unique
  covalent docking methodology was harnessed to unravel the structural and
  molecular determinants underpinning its inactivation. Findings from our study
  lay the foundation for future investigation of clinically-relevant drug-drug
  interactions between PEM and concomitant substrates of CYP3A.

We recently established the mechanism-based inactivation (MBI) of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) by the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors erdafitinib and infigratinib. Serendipitously, our preliminary data has also revealed that pemigatinib (PEM) - another clinically approved FGFR1-3 inhibitor - similarly elicited time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A. This was rather unexpected as it was previously purported that PEM did not pose any metabolism-dependent liabilities due to the absence of glutathione-related conjugates in metabolic profiling experiments conducted in human liver microsomes. Here, we confirmed that PEM inhibited both CYP3A isoforms in a time-, concentration-, and cofactor-dependent manner consistent with MBI - with *K*I, *k*inact, and partition ratio of 8.69 and 11.95 μM, 0.108 and 0.042 min−1, and \~44 and \~47 for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 respectively. While the rate of inactivation was diminished by coincubation with an alternative substrate or direct inhibitor of CYP3A, the inclusion of nucleophilic trapping agents afforded no such protection. Furthermore, the lack of catalytic activity recovery following dialysis and oxidation with potassium ferricyanide coupled with the absence of a spectrally resolvable peak in the Soret region collectively implied that the underlying mechanism of inactivation was not elicited via the formation of pseudo-irreversible metabolite-intermediate complexes. Finally, utilizing cyanide trapping and high-resolution mass spectrometry, we illuminated the direct and sequential oxidative bioactivation of PEM and its major *O*-desmethylated metabolite at its distal morpholine moiety to reactive iminium ion hard electrophilic species that could covalently mechanism-based inactivate CYP3A.
