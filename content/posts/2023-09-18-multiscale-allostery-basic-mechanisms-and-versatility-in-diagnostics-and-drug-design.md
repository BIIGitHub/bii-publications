There were several significant milestones in the last century, from the discovery of the Bohr effect[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0005) to understanding that every dynamic protein is intrinsically allosteric.[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0010), [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0015) It started slowly and took several, decades-long steps to make progress in the analysis of oxygen binding cooperativity[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0020), [5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0025) before the term allostery was coined in 1961.[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0030) The seminal Monod–Changeux–Jacob work “Allosteric proteins and cellular control systems”[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0035) provided the first formal description of allostery, followed by its implementation in the phenomenological Monod–Wyman–Changeux[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0040) and Koshland–Nemethy–Filmer[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0045) models developed for oligomeric proteins. About a decade later, the key role of protein dynamics[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0050) was formalized in the free-energy landscape view,[11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0055), [12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0060) which allows to uniformly describe allosteric regulation of protein function[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0065) in the context of conformational ensembles with transitions between corresponding functional states.[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0015), [14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0070) On the brink of 21st century critical improvements in resolution of major biophysical techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR, turning them, at the same time, into high-throughput approaches delivered atomic details and pictures of dynamics for tens of thousands of proteins and protein assemblies.[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0075) These data revealed the pervasiveness of allostery[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0010) in a wide spectrum of proteins from small single-chain structures to huge molecular assemblies, machines and beyond,[16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0080), [17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0085) showing how allostery affects multiple structural and functional facets of biomolecules on different scales. As a result, the number of works on the physical bases, molecular mechanisms, and biological implications of allostery rapidly increased,[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0090) expanding the “allosteric territory” borders[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0095) to include the realm of engineering and design with multiple biomedical applications.[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0075) In particular, allostery became one of the cornerstones of the precision medicine paradigm,[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283622003539?via%3Dihub#b0090) providing a foundation for development of personalized therapies with distinct specificity and dosage.
