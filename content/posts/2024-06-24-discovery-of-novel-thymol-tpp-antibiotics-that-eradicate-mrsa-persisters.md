  - TPP + -thymol conjugates are novel antibacterial agents and could serve as a
  new therapeutic strategy for combating antibiotic resistance.

  - Thy3d improves antibacterial activity with undetectable resistance.

  - Thy3d is capable of killing MRSA persisters.

  - Thy3d disrupts membrane integrity for both normal bacteria and persisters.

The high prevalence of methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) strains and the formation of non-growing, dormant "persisters" subsets help bacteria evade antibiotic treatment and enhance bacterial resistance, which poses a serious threat to human life and health. It is urgent to discover novel antibacterial therapies effective against MRSA persisters. Thymol is a common nutraceutical with weak antibacterial and antitumor activities. A series of Thymol triphenylphosphine (TPP) conjugates (**TPP-Thy3**) was designed and synthesized. These compounds showed significantly improved inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria compared with Thymol. Among them, **Thy3d** displayed a low probability of resistance selection and showed excellent biocompatibility. Interestingly, **Thy3d** elicited a rapid killing effect of MRSA persisters (99.999%) at high concentration. Fluorescence experiments, electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulation and bilayer experiment confirmed that **Thy3d** conjugates exerted potent antimicrobial activity by disrupting the integrity of the membrane of bacterial even the persister. Furthermore, **Thy3d** exhibited considerable efficacy in a mouse model of subcutaneous murine MRSA infection. In summary, **TPP-Thy3** conjugates are a series of novel antibacterial agents and could serve as a new therapeutic strategy for combating antibiotic resistance.
