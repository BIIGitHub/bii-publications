Catalytic proteins such as human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), with conserved and highly polar active sites, warrant the discovery of druggable nonactive sites, such as allosteric sites, and potentially, therapeutic small molecules that can bind to these sites. Catalyzing the dephosphorylation of numerous substrates, PTP1B is physiologically important in intracellular signal transduction pathways in diverse cell types and tissues. Aberrant PTP1B is associated with obesity, diabetes, cancers, and neurodegenerative disorders. Utilizing clustering methods (based on root mean square deviation, principal component analysis, nonnegative matrix factorization, and independent component analysis), we have examined multiple PTP1B structures. Using the resulting representative structures in different conformational states, we determined consensus clustroids and used them to identify both known and novel binding sites, some of which are potentially allosteric. We report several lead compounds that could potentially bind to the novel PTP1B binding sites and can be further optimized. Considering the possibility for drug repurposing, we discovered homologous binding sites in other proteins, with ligands that could potentially bind to the novel PTP1B binding sites.
