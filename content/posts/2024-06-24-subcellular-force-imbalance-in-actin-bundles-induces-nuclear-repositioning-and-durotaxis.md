Durotaxis is a phenomenon in which cells migrate toward substrates of increasing stiffness. However, how cells assimilate substrate stiffness as a directional cue remains poorly understood. In this study, we experimentally show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts can discriminate between different substrate stiffnesses and develop higher traction forces at regions of the cell adhering to the stiffer pillars. In this way, the cells generate a force imbalance between adhesion sites. It is this traction force imbalance that drives durotaxis by providing directionality for cell migration. Significantly, we found that traction forces are transmitted via LINC complexes to the cell nucleus, which serves to maintain the global force imbalance. In this way, LINC complexes play an essential role in anterograde nuclear movement and durotaxis. This conclusion is supported by the fact that LINC complex-deficient cells are incapable of durotaxis and instead migrate randomly on substrates featuring a stiffness gradient.
