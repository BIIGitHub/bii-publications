  Use of high-throughput, in vitro bioactivity data in setting a
  point-of-departure (POD) has the potential to accelerate the pace of human
  health safety evaluation by informing screening level assessments. The primary
  objective of this work was to compare PODs based on high-throughput
  predictions of bioactivity, exposure predictions, and traditional hazard
  information for 448 chemicals. PODs derived from new approach methodologies
  (NAMs) were obtained for this comparison using the 50th (PODNAM,50) and the
  95th (PODNAM,95) percentile credible interval estimates for the steady-state
  plasma concentration used in in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of administered
  equivalent doses (AEDs). Of the 448 substances, 89% had a PODNAM,95 that was
  less than the traditional POD (PODtraditional) value.

Use of high-throughput, in vitro bioactivity data in setting a point-of-departure (POD) has the potential to accelerate the pace of human health safety evaluation by informing screening level assessments. The primary objective of this work was to compare PODs based on high-throughput predictions of bioactivity, exposure predictions, and traditional hazard information for 448 chemicals. PODs derived from new approach methodologies (NAMs) were obtained for this comparison using the 50th (PODNAM,50) and the 95th (PODNAM,95) percentile credible interval estimates for the steady-state plasma concentration used in in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of administered equivalent doses (AEDs). Of the 448 substances, 89% had a PODNAM,95 that was less than the traditional POD (PODtraditional) value. For the 48 substances for which PODtraditional < PODNAM,95, the PODNAM and PODtraditional were typically within a factor of 10 of each other, and there was an enrichment of chemical structural features associated with organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. When PODtraditional < PODNAM,95, it did not appear to result from an enrichment of PODtraditional based on a particular study type, (e.g. developmental, reproductive, chronic studies). Bioactivity:exposure ratios (BERs), useful for identification of substances with potential priority, demonstrated that high-throughput exposure predictions were greater than the PODNAM,95 for 11 substances. When compared to threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) values, the PODNAM,95 was greater than the corresponding TTC value 90% of the time. This work demonstrates the feasibility, and continuing challenges, of using in vitro bioactivity as a protective estimate of POD in screening level assessments via a case study.
