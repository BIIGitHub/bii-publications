Antibiotics have played a critical role in sustaining and improving [livestock production](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/livestock-production "Learn more about livestock production from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in the past decades, but the emergence of [antimicrobial resistance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/antimicrobial-resistance "Learn more about antimicrobial resistance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") has led several countries to ban or limit their use. Since then, in-feed alternatives have gained a lot of attention but the development of efficacious alternatives implies a better understanding of the mode of action of antibiotic growth promoters (**AGP**) when administered at subtherapeutic concentrations. In the present study, 120 [broiler chickens](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/broiler-chickens "Learn more about broiler chickens from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") per group (8 pens/group) were fed for 35 d with either basal feed (control group) or feed supplemented with avilamycin (AGP group; 10 g/1,000 kg of feed). At the end of the trial, the ileum from the small intestine of 5 birds per group was sampled, and RNA were isolated for profiling their [transcriptome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/transcriptome "Learn more about transcriptome from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") via [RNA sequencing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/shotgun-sequencing "Learn more about RNA sequencing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (**RNA-Seq**). As expected, the growth of chickens in the AGP group was significantly higher than in the control group. Overall, 66 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate ≤ 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2 or ≤ −2) were found in the ileum of chickens fed avilamycin in comparison with the control group. The functional analysis showed reduced activity of genes related to signaling by [interleukins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/interleukins "Learn more about interleukins from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), with IL-22, [SOCS3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/socs3 "Learn more about SOCS3 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and certain [antimicrobial peptides](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/antimicrobial-peptides "Learn more about antimicrobial peptides from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") found multiple times in these pathways in the AGP group at day 35. In addition, higher activity was predicted in a module of genes related to [lipid metabolism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/lipid-metabolism "Learn more about lipid metabolism from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and transport in the avilamycin group. The use of RNA-Seq allowed a snapshot of the whole transcriptome at day 35 and aimed at delivering additional data on the host-centric hypothesis regarding the mode of action of AGP (i.e. immunomodulation, reduction of the immunological stress).
