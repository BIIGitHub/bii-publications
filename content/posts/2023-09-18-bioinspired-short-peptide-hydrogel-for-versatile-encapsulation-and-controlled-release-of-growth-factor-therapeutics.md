A short bioinspired octapeptide, GV8, can self-assemble under mild conditions into biodegradable supramolecular physical hydrogels with high [storage modulus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/elastic-moduli "Learn more about storage modulus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and good biocompatibility. GV8 hydrogels can encapsulate both single or multiple macromolecular protein-based therapeutics in a simple one-pot formulation manner, making it a promising candidate to address challenges faced by existing [synthetic polymer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/synthetic-polymer "Learn more about synthetic polymer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") or peptide hydrogels with complex [gelation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/gelation "Learn more about gelation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and drug-encapsulation processes. Alongside its versatility, the hydrogel exhibits concentration-dependent [storage modulus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/elastic-moduli "Learn more about storage modulus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and controlled drug-release action. We demonstrate that GV8 hydrogels loaded with adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSC) [secretome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/secretome "Learn more about secretome from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") remain mechanically robust, and exhibit promising potential for wound healing applications by preserving [secretome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/secretome "Learn more about secretome from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") activity while maintaining a constant supply of ADMSC secretome to promote epithelial cell migration. Overall, our work highlights the potential of GV8 peptide hydrogel as a versatile and safe carrier for encapsulation and delivery of macromolecular therapeutics.
