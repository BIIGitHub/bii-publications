description: New antimicrobials are urgently needed to combat Gram-negative
  bacteria, particularly multi-drug resistant (MDR) and phenotypically resistant
  biofilm species. At present, only sequence-defined alpha-peptides (e.g.
  polymyxin B) can selectively target Gram-negative bacterial
  lipopolysaccharides. We show that a copolymer, without a defined sequence,
  shows good potency against MDR Gram-negative bacteria including its biofilm
  form.

New antimicrobials are urgently needed to combat Gram-negative bacteria, particularly multi-drug resistant (MDR) and phenotypically resistant [biofilm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/biofilms "Learn more about biofilm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") species. At present, only sequence-defined alpha-peptides (*e.g.* polymyxin B) can selectively target Gram-negative bacterial [lipopolysaccharides](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/lipopolysaccharide "Learn more about lipopolysaccharides from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). We show that a [copolymer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/copolymer "Learn more about copolymer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), without a defined sequence, shows good potency against MDR Gram-negative bacteria including its [biofilm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/biofilms "Learn more about biofilm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") form. The tapered blocky co-beta-peptide with controlled N-terminal [hydrophobicity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/hydrophobicity "Learn more about hydrophobicity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (#4) has strong interaction with the Gram-negative bacterial [lipopolysaccharides](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/lipopolysaccharide "Learn more about lipopolysaccharides from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") via its backbone through electrostatic and [hydrogen bonding](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/hydrogen-bonding "Learn more about hydrogen bonding from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") interactions but not the Gram-positive bacterial and [mammalian cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mammalian-cell "Learn more about mammalian cell from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") membranes so that this [copolymer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/copolymer "Learn more about copolymer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is non-toxic to these two latter cell types. The new #4 co-beta-peptide selectively kills Gram-negative bacteria with low cytotoxicity both *in vitro* and in a mouse biofilm wound infection model. This strategy provides a new concept for the design of Gram-negative selective antimicrobial [peptidomimetics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/peptidomimetic "Learn more about peptidomimetics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") against MDR and biofilm species.
