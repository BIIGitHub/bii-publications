Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a rare and benign inflammatory breast disease with ambiguous aetiology. Contrastingly, lactational mastitis (LM) is commonly diagnosed in breastfeeding women. To investigate IGM aetiology, we profiled the microbial flora of pus and skin in patients with IGM and LM. A total of 26 patients with IGM and 6 patients with LM were included in the study. The 16S rRNA sequencing libraries were constructed from 16S rRNA gene amplified from total DNA extracted from pus and skin swabs in patients with IGM and LM controls. Constructed libraries were multiplexed and paired-end sequenced on HiSeq4000. Metagenomic analysis was conducted using modified microbiome abundance analysis suite customised R-resource for paired pus and skin samples. Microbiome multivariable association analyses were performed using linear models. A total of 21 IGM and 3 LM paired pus and skin samples underwent metagenomic analysis. Bray−Curtis ecological dissimilarity distance showed dissimilarity across four sample types (IGM pus, IGM skin, LM pus, and LM skin; PERMANOVA, p < 0.001). No characteristic dominant genus was observed across the IGM samples. The IGM pus samples were more diverse than corresponding IGM skin samples (Shannon and Simpson index; Wilcoxon paired signed-rank tests, p = 0.022 and p = 0.07). Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii, reportedly associated with IGM in the literature, was higher in IGM pus samples than paired skin samples (Wilcoxon, p = 0.022). Three other species and nineteen genera were statistically significant in paired IGM pus–skin comparison after antibiotic treatment adjustment and multiple comparisons correction. Microbial profiles are unique between patients with IGM and LM. Inter-patient variability and polymicrobial IGM pus samples cannot implicate specific genus or species as an infectious cause for IGM.
