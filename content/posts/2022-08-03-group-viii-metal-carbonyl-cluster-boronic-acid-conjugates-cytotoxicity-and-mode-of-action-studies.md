  group VIII metals (Fe, Ru, and Os) were synthesized and their
  antiproliferative effects measured against two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7
  and MDA-MB-231) and a noncancerous breast epithelial (MCF-10A) cell line.

A set of metal carbonyl cluster-boronic acid conjugates of the group VIII metals (Fe, Ru, and Os) were synthesized and their antiproliferative effects measured against two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and a noncancerous breast epithelial (MCF-10A) cell line. The cytotoxicity followed the order Ru > Os > Fe for the MDA-MB-231 cells, although the latter two exhibited similar cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells. The osmium species {Os3(CO)10(μ-H)[μ-SC6H4-*p*-B(OH)2]} (**2**) could be chemically oxidized to its hydroxy analogue [Os3(CO)10(μ-H)(μ-SC6H4*\-p*-OH)] (**2-OH**), which showed comparable cytotoxicity. Mode of action studies pointed to an apoptotic pathway for cell death.
