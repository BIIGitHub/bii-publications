Tuberculosis (TB), the deadly disease caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (*Mtb*), kills more people worldwide than any other bacterial infectious disease. There has been a recent resurgence of TB drug discovery activities, resulting in the identification of a number of novel [enzyme inhibitors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/enzyme-inhibitor "Learn more about enzyme inhibitors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Many of these inhibitors target the [electron transport chain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/electron-transport-chain "Learn more about electron transport chain from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") complexes and the F1FO-ATP synthase; these enzymes represent new target spaces for drug discovery, since the generation of ATP is essential for the bacterial pathogen's physiology, persistence, and pathogenicity. The anti-TB drug [bedaquiline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/bedaquiline "Learn more about bedaquiline from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (BDQ) targets the *Mtb* F-ATP synthase and is used as salvage therapy against this disease. Medicinal chemistry efforts to improve the physio-chemical properties of BDQ resulted in the discovery of 3,5-dialkoxypyridine (DARQ) analogs to which TBAJ-876 belongs. TBAJ-876, a clinical development candidate, shows attractive *in vitro* and *in vivo* antitubercular activity. Both BDQ and TBAJ-876 inhibit the mycobacterial F1FO-ATP synthase by stopping rotation of the *c*-ring turbine within the FO domain, thereby preventing [proton translocation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/proton-transport "Learn more about proton translocation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and ATP synthesis to occur. While structural data for the BDQ bound state are available, no structural information about TBAJ-876 binding have been described. In this study, we show how TBAJ-876 binds to the FO domain of the *M. smegmatis* F1FO-ATP synthase. We further calculate the binding free energy of both drugs bound to their target and predict an increased affinity of TBAJ-876 for the FO domain. This approach will be useful in future efforts to design new and highly potent DARQ analogs targeting F-ATP synthases of *Mtb*, nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) as well as the *M. leprosis* complex.
