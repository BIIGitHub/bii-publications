### Background & Aims:

SLC25A47 was initially identified as a mitochondrial HCC-downregulated carrier protein, but its physiological functions and transport substrates are unknown. We aimed to investigate the physiological role of SLC25A47 in hepatic metabolism.

### Approach & Results:

In the treatment of hepatocytes with metformin, we found that metformin can transcriptionally activate the expression of *Slc25a47*, which is required for AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) phosphorylation. *Slc25a47*-deficient mice had increased hepatic lipid content, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels, and we found that *Slc25a47* deficiency suppressed AMPKα phosphorylation and led to an increased accumulation of nuclear SREBPs, with elevated fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic activities. Conversely, when *Slc25a47* was overexpressed in mouse liver, AMPKα was activated and resulted in the inhibition of lipogenesis. Moreover, using a diethylnitrosamine-induced mouse HCC model, we found that the deletion of *Slc25a47* promoted HCC tumorigenesis and development through the activated mammalian target of rapamycin cascade. Employing homology modeling of SLC25A47 and virtual screening of the human metabolome database, we demonstrated that NAD+ was an endogenous substrate for SLC25A47, and the activity of NAD+-dependent sirtuin 3 declined in *Slc25a47*-deficient mice, followed by inactivation of AMPKα.

### Conclusions:

Our findings reveal that SLC25A47, a hepatocyte-specific mitochondrial NAD+ transporter, is one of the pharmacological targets of metformin and regulates lipid homeostasis through AMPKα, and may serve as a potential drug target for treating NAFLD and HCC.
