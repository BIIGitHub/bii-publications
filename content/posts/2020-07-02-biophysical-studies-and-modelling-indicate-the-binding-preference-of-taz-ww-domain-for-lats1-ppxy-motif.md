  The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway is an important regulator of cell
  proliferation and apoptosis, and signal transduction occurs through
  phosphorylation of the effector protein TAZ by the serine/threonine kinase
  LATS1/2. Here, we report the biophysical and computational studies to
  characterize the interaction between TAZ and LATS1/2 through WW domain-PPxY
  motif binding.

The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway is an important regulator of[cell proliferation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cell-proliferation "Learn more about Cell Proliferation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")and apoptosis, and[signal transduction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/signal-transduction "Learn more about Signal Transduction from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")occurs through phosphorylation of the effector protein TAZ by the serine/threonine kinase LATS1/2. Here, we report the biophysical and computational studies to characterize the interaction between TAZ and LATS1/2 through WW domain-PPxY motif binding. We show that the TAZ WW domain exhibits a binding preference for the second of the two PPxY motifs of LATS1*in vitro*. We modelled the structure of the domain in complex with LATS1 PPxY2 peptide and, through molecular dynamics simulations, show that WW domain-PPxY2 complex is stable with some flexibility in the peptide region. Next, we predict and verify that L143 and T150 of the WW domain are important for TAZ binding with the PPxY2 peptide using mutational and isothermal titration calorimetric studies. Furthermore, we suggest that the electrostatic potential of charged residues within the binding pocket may influence the ligand affinity among otherwise highly similar WW domains.
