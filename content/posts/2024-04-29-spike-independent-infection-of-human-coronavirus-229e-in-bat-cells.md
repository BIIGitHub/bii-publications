description: Many viruses, including coronaviruses, originated from bats. Yet,
  we know little about how these viruses switch between hosts and enter human
  populations. Coronaviruses have succeeded in establishing in humans at least
  five times, including endemic coronaviruses and the recent severe acute
  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Bats are the reservoir for numerous human pathogens, including coronaviruses. Despite many coronaviruses having descended from bat ancestors, little is known about virus-host interactions and broader evolutionary history involving bats. Studies have largely focused on the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses with few infection experiments conducted in bat cells. To determine genetic changes derived from replication in bat cells and possibly identify potential novel evolutionary pathways for zoonotic virus emergence, we serially passaged six human 229E isolates in a newly established *Rhinolophus lepidus* (horseshoe bat) kidney cell line. Here, we observed extensive deletions within the spike and open reading frame 4 (ORF4) genes of five 229E viruses after passaging in bat cells. As a result, spike protein expression and infectivity of human cells was lost in 5 of 6 viruses, but the capability to infect bat cells was maintained. Only viruses that expressed the spike protein could be neutralized by 229E spike-specific antibodies in human cells, whereas there was no neutralizing effect on viruses that did not express the spike protein inoculated on bat cells. However, one isolate acquired an early stop codon, abrogating spike expression but maintaining infection in bat cells. After passaging this isolate in human cells, spike expression was restored due to acquisition of nucleotide insertions among virus subpopulations. Spike-independent infection of human coronavirus 229E may provide an alternative mechanism for viral maintenance in bats that does not rely on the compatibility of viral surface proteins and known cellular entry receptors.
