  Bacteria use a number of mechanisms to defend themselves from antimicrobial
  drugs. One important defense strategy is the ability to export drugs by
  multidrug transporters. One class of multidrug transporter, the so-called
  multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters, extrude a variety
  of antibiotic compounds from the bacterial cytoplasm.

Bacteria use a number of mechanisms to defend themselves from antimicrobial drugs. One important defense strategy is the ability to export drugs by multidrug transporters. One class of multidrug transporter, the so-called multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters, extrude a variety of antibiotic compounds from the bacterial cytoplasm. These MATE transporters are driven by a Na+, H+, or combined Na+/H+ gradient, and act as antiporters to drive a conformational change in the transporter from the outward to the inward-facing conformation. In the inward-facing conformation, a chemical compound (drug) binds to the protein, resulting in a switch to the opposite conformation, thereby extruding the drug. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we now report the structural basis for Na+ and H+ binding in the dual ion coupled MATE transporter ClbM from Escherichia coli, which is connected to colibactin-induced genotoxicity, yielding novel insights into the ion/drug translocation mechanism of this bacterial transporter.
