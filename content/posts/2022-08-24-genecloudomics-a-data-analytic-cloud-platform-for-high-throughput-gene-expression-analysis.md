description: Multi-dimensional biological data is rapidly accumulating, and it
  is expected that the size of the data will exceed astronomical levels by 2025
  (Stephens et al., 2015). This resulted in the development of computational
  tools that became vital in driving scientific discovery in recent times
  (Markowetz, 2017). A parallel increase in the development of online servers
  and databases has also been witnessed (Helmy et al., 2016), raising a new set
  of challenges related to the usability and maintenance of all these tools
  (Mangul et al., 2019). About half of the computational biology tools were
  found to be difficult to install, 28% of them are unavailable online in the
  provided URLs, and many others are missing adequate documentation and manuals
  (Mangul et al., 2019). The problem gets more complex with the limited
  computational and coding skills of two-thirds of the biologists who use these
  tools (Schultheiss, 2011). On the other hand, it was also noted that
  bioinformatics tools that are easy to install and use are highly cited,
  indicating wider usability by the community and a larger contribution to
  scientific discovery (Mangul et al., 2019). Thus, more web-based tools that
  avoid installation difficulties and operating system compatibility issues,
  simple point-and-click tools are required to tackle multi-dimensional omics
  datasets.

Gene expression profiling techniques, such as DNA microarray and RNA-Sequencing, have provided significant impact on our understanding of biological systems. They contribute to almost all aspects of biomedical research, including studying developmental biology, host-parasite relationships, disease progression and drug effects. However, the high-throughput data generations present challenges for many wet experimentalists to analyze and take full advantage of such rich and complex data. Here we present GeneCloudOmics, an easy-to-use web server for high-throughput gene expression analysis that extends the functionality of our previous ABioTrans with several new tools, including protein datasets analysis, and a web interface. GeneCloudOmics allows both microarray and RNA-Seq data analysis with a comprehensive range of data analytics tools in one package that no other current standalone software or web-based tool can do. In total, GeneCloudOmics provides the user access to 23 different data analytical and bioinformatics tasks including reads normalization, scatter plots, linear/non-linear correlations, PCA, clustering (hierarchical, k-means, t-SNE, SOM), differential expression analyses, pathway enrichments, evolutionary analyses, pathological analyses, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) identifications. Furthermore, GeneCloudOmics allows the direct import of gene expression data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. The user can perform all tasks rapidly through an intuitive graphical user interface that overcomes the hassle of coding, installing tools/packages/libraries and dealing with operating systems compatibility and version issues, complications that make data analysis tasks challenging for biologists. Thus, GeneCloudOmics is a one-stop open-source tool for gene expression data analysis and visualization. It is freely available at <http://combio-sifbi.org/GeneCloudOmics>.
